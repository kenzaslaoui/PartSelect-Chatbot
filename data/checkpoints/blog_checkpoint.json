In this article we’ll break down the differences between frost and ice buildup, and how the location of the buildup can indicate which part of your freezer is causing the issue. We’ll show you the steps to repair the faulty parts, along with some tips to prevent frost buildup from becoming a recurring problem in your freezer.</p>\n<p>To begin our repair, we’re going to start by completely defrosting the freezer. Please note that any of the repair guides and videos below are general information based on a fridge with freezer on top. The steps will vary based on your appliance model and location of the freezer (such as side-by-side or on the bottom). To find the instructions for your specific freezer, please search for the model number on our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/PartSelect\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube channel.</a></p>\n<h2>How to Remove Ice or Frost Buildup from Your Freezer</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>The first step is to unplug the appliance.</li>\n<li>Remove all food from the freezer and place it into a cooler or a spare freezer. You may want to remove food from the fridge as well. However, if you place frozen blocks inside and keep the fridge door shut the entire time, your fridge content may be fine during the repair.</li>\n<li>Note the location of the ice or frost buildup in your freezer, then leave the freezer door open to allow it to melt.</li>\n<li>As the ice softens, gently remove it with a plastic spatula or cloth. Don’t use sharp or metal tools, which can damage the inner surfaces of your freezer.</li>\n<li>Based on where the buildup was located, follow the recommended inspections below to determine the issue and begin your repair.</li>\n<li>Once your repair is complete, you can thoroughly clean and then plug the appliance back in. Wait until the freezer comes down to temperature before replacing your food items.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Frost on the Freezer Walls or Door</h2>\n<p>If you have frost throughout the freezer, such as along the walls and even on the door, this is due to warm, humid air entering the freezer. Simple things like opening the freezer door too frequently, placing hot food in the freezer, or leaving the door ajar can cause frost to form in these locations. Another cause may be a faulty door gasket. If the freezer door gasket is dirty or damaged, it can prevent the door from tightly sealing, which causes the room temperature air to leak into the freezer. This issue is easy to fix by either cleaning or <a href=\"https://www.partselect.com/Refrigerator-Seals-and-Gaskets.htm\" target=\"_blank\">replacing the gasket.</a></p>\n<h3>How to Fix a Freezer Door Gasket</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The first step is to visually inspect the door gasket and surrounding door area for crumbs, spills, or items that may prevent the door from sealing properly. When inspecting the gasket, check to see if it is torn, warped, or otherwise damaged.</li>\n<li>If the area is dirty, use a soft, damp cloth to clean up any spills or debris. If the gasket wasn’t damaged, your freezer door should now close properly, preventing any further frost buildup.</li>\n<li>If the freezer door gasket is cracked or split, it will need to be replaced. The method may vary depending on your freezer model, but it typically requires few or no tools to complete.</li>\n</ol>\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;\">\n<div class=\"yt-video\" data-iframe-id=\"iframePlayerzrL0bqWsbRc\" data-yt-init=\"zrL0bqWsbRc\" tabindex=\"0\"><img alt=\"How to Prevent Ice Buildup in a Freezer\" class=\"b-lazy yt-video__thumb b-lazy\" data-src=\"https://img.youtube.com/vi/zrL0bqWsbRc/maxresdefault.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"/><svg class=\"i i--yt\"><use href=\"/images/part-info-sprite.svg#yt\"></use></svg></div>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<h2>Frost (or Ice) on the Back Walls</h2>\n<p>The evaporator coils are located behind the back wall of the freezer, and this is typically the coldest spot where frost will form first. Modern fridges have a defrost mode that cycles on, which heats up the evaporator coils to remove any frost buildup. If a component of the defrost cycle is faulty, it can lead to build-up along the back of the freezer walls. The parts that may be causing this issue are the temperature sensor or thermostat, the heater, or the timer. To see if one of these components has failed, you can use a multimeter to test the part. While the exact location and steps to replace each of these components will vary by make and model, the videos below will provide an overview of the procedure.</p>\n<h3>How to Replace a Defrost Timer</h3>\n<p>The tools you will likely need for this repair may include a Phillips screwdriver, a flathead screwdriver, or a quarter-inch nut driver.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If your fridge is not already unplugged from defrosting the freezer, begin your repair by disconnecting the power from the appliance.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://www.partselect.com/Refrigerator-Timers.htm\" target=\"_blank\">defrost timer</a> will be found within the control assembly inside the refrigerator. To remove the control assembly, you may need to remove shelving from the fridge, along with the lightbulb for easier access. You will then need to remove any bolts or screws holding the control housing in place and remove it from the fridge.</li>\n<li>Place the control assembly on a work surface in order to remove the defrost timer from the housing. To remove the defrost timer, you will need to disconnect the wire harness, and you may need to remove bolts or screws if the timer is secured to the control housing. A flathead screwdriver can be used to remove the wire harness if it is not easy to pull off.</li>\n<li>The old defrost timer can be discarded, and the new one can be installed by reversing the above steps.</li>\n</ol>\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;\">\n<div class=\"yt-video\" data-iframe-id=\"iframePlayerTABAFjm27qI\" data-yt-init=\"TABAFjm27qI\" tabindex=\"0\"><img alt=\"How to Prevent Ice Buildup in a Freezer\" class=\"b-lazy yt-video__thumb b-lazy\" data-src=\"https://img.youtube.com/vi/TABAFjm27qI/maxresdefault.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"/><svg class=\"i i--yt\"><use href=\"/images/part-info-sprite.svg#yt\"></use></svg></div>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<h3>How to Replace a Defrost Heater</h3>\n<p>The tools you will likely need may include a Phillips screwdriver, putty knife, needle nose pliers, and a quarter-inch nut driver.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If your fridge is not already unplugged from defrosting the freezer, begin your repair by disconnecting the power to the appliance.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://www.partselect.com/Refrigerator-Elements-and-Burners.htm\" target=\"_blank\">defrost heater</a> is located behind the back wall of the freezer, so all food items and shelving will need to be removed in order to access the part.

A hot compressor is typically caused by dirty condenser coils, a malfunctioning fan motor, a faulty thermostat, or low refrigerant levels. It can also be caused by something as simple as overloading the fridge with groceries or placing the fridge too close to the wall.  Understanding the root causes of a hot compressor is essential to maintaining your refrigerator’s efficiency and longevity. In this article, we'll explore the common reasons behind a hot refrigerator compressor, and practical step-by-step solutions to help you resolve the issue, and ensure your refrigerator runs smoothly and keeps your food fresh.</p>\n<h2>What Does the Compressor Do in a Refrigerator?</h2>\n<p>The compressor is a crucial part of the refrigeration cycle, which is the process whereby heat is removed from inside the refrigerator to keep it cool. The compressor pressurizes the refrigerant gas, which is converted into a liquid when it passes through the condenser coils. The liquid evaporates and absorbs heat from the interior of the fridge and cools it down. The cooled air is then circulated throughout the refrigerator to keep the food items cold. The gas returns to the compressor where it begins this cycle again. In summary, the compressor is responsible for pressurizing and circulating the refrigerant throughout the refrigeration system and facilitating the removal of heat from inside the refrigerator to the outside environment.\n\n<p>If the compressor overheats, it may be unable to compress refrigerant gas effectively, resulting in reduced cooling capacity and longer cooling cycles. It will also consume more energy as it struggles to maintain the desired temperature inside the refrigerator. This can lead to higher electricity bills and unnecessary energy use. Furthermore, overheating over a long period of time can damage the internal components of the compressor, such as the motor windings, and electrical connections. Over time, this can lead to premature compressor failure and the need for costly repairs. If the compressor continues to overheat, it may eventually fail completely. A failed compressor can cause the entire refrigeration system to stop working, leaving your refrigerator unable to function at all. Therefore, if you notice that your compressor is getting hotter than usual, you should address this promptly.</p>\n<h2>How Dirty Refrigerator Condenser Coils Lead to a Hot Compressor</h2>\n<p>The condenser coils are designed to release heat generated from inside the refrigerator. When these coils are covered in dust, dirt, or debris, they will be unable to carry out this function efficiently and the overall temperature of the refrigeration system increases. As a result, the compressor has to work harder and run more frequently to maintain the desired internal temperature.

A hot compressor is typically caused by dirty condenser coils, a malfunctioning fan motor, a faulty thermostat, or low refrigerant levels. It can also be caused by something as simple as overloading the fridge with groceries or placing the fridge too close to the wall. Understanding the root causes of a hot compressor is essential to maintaining your refrigerator’s efficiency and longevity. In this article, we'll explore the common reasons behind a hot refrigerator compressor, and practical step-by-step solutions to help you resolve the issue, and ensure your refrigerator runs smoothly and keeps your food fresh. What Does the Compressor Do in a Refrigerator? The compressor is a crucial part of the refrigeration cycle, which is the process whereby heat is removed from inside the refrigerator to keep it cool. The compressor pressurizes the refrigerant gas, which is converted into a liquid when it passes through the condenser coils. The liquid evaporates and absorbs heat from the interior of the fridge and cools it down. The cooled air is then circulated throughout the refrigerator to keep the food items cold. The gas returns to the compressor where it begins this cycle again. In summary, the compressor is responsible for pressurizing and circulating the refrigerant throughout the refrigeration system and facilitating the removal of heat from inside the refrigerator to the outside environment. If the compressor overheats, it may be unable to compress refrigerant gas effectively, resulting in reduced cooling capacity and longer cooling cycles. It will also consume more energy as it struggles to maintain the desired temperature inside the refrigerator. This can lead to higher electricity bills and unnecessary energy use. Furthermore, overheating over a long period of time can damage the internal components of the compressor, such as the motor windings, and electrical connections. Over time, this can lead to premature compressor failure and the need for costly repairs. If the compressor continues to overheat, it may eventually fail completely. A failed compressor can cause the entire refrigeration system to stop working, leaving your refrigerator unable to function at all. Therefore, if you notice that your compressor is getting hotter than usual, you should address this promptly. How Dirty Refrigerator Condenser Coils Lead to a Hot Compressor The condenser coils are designed to release heat generated from inside the refrigerator. When these coils are covered in dust, dirt, or debris, they will be unable to carry out this function efficiently and the overall temperature of the refrigeration system increases. As a result, the compressor has to work harder and run more frequently to maintain the desired internal temperature. Over time, this constant strain can cause the compressor to overheat, increase energy costs, and lower the overall efficiency of the refrigerator. How to Clean Condenser Coils to Fix a Hot Compressor Before you begin cleaning, unplug the refrigerator from the power outlet to avoid electric shock. You can typically find the condenser coil either on the back of the refrigerator or underneath the door behind a grille. If the coils are at the bottom, you may need to remove the access panel or grille covering them. This may involve unscrewing a few screws or simply snapping off the grille, depending on your refrigerator model. Once you have access to the coils, use a coil cleaning brush or a vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment to remove any dirt or debris. Be careful to avoid damaging the coils. For any hard-to-reach areas where dust may accumulate, you can use a narrow brush or a can of compressed air to reach these areas. Once the coils are clean and you've inspected them for damage, reassemble any panels or grilles you removed and plug the refrigerator back into the power outlet. How a Faulty Refrigerator Thermostat Leads to a Hot Compressor The thermostat is designed to monitor the internal temperature of the refrigerator and signal the compressor to turn on or off to maintain the correct temperature. If the thermostat is faulty, it may not accurately read the temperature inside the refrigerator. It may continuously signal the compressor to run even if the temperature is already at the desired level. When the compressor runs continuously without the necessary breaks, it can lead to the compressor becoming extremely hot as it is constantly working to cool down the refrigerator. You will need to replace the refrigerator thermostat to restore the proper functioning of your appliance.

Signs of a specific issue may include blinking lights, or starting and then stopping abruptly when filling. It's normal for dishwashers to pause mid-cycle to drain or heat water up, but there's a distinct difference between pausing and shutting off completely. Resetting your dishwasher or manually activating the drain can resolve it stopping mid-cycle, but the underlying cause must still be fixed, which means inspecting and testing a number of parts. Whether it's a simple fix like a clogged drain filter or a more complex issue like a malfunctioning door latch assembly or control board, this article will guide you through the required supplies, and instructions for diagnosing and fixing your dishwasher if it's stopping in the middle of a cycle.</p>\n<h2>General Problems that Cause a Dishwasher to Stop Mid-Cycle</h2>\n<p>It can be frustrating when your dishwasher stops mid-cycle, but understanding some general problems that can cause it will help you fix it quicker. We'll explore a few common issues, like a clogged filter and drain hose, low water pressure, and power failures, to help you resolve this stopping problem quickly and easily.</p>\n<h3>Clogged Filter and Drain Hose</h3>\n<p>A dishwasher's filter and hose, which are parts of the draining system, are used to trap food particles and debris from harming valuable parts like the pump, and remove dirty water from the dishwasher. If either of these parts is clogged, blocked, or damaged, the dishwasher will stop to avoid any overflow or potential damage to your home or its parts. If you see a series of lights or an error code appear when this occurs, note it and refer to your user manual for further information on the issue.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Unplug your dishwasher and turn off its water supply.</li>\n<li>Open the dishwasher door and remove its filter. This may require a screwdriver or pliers to remove.</li>\n<li>Inspect the inside of the filter and its housing for any clogs caused by gunk or debris, and use a brush or sponge, and warm soapy water to clean the filter. If the <a href=\"https://www.partselect.com/Dishwasher-Filters.htm\" target=\"_blank\">filter</a> is damaged, replace it immediately.</li>\n<li>Once the filter and its housing are cleaned, locate the dishwasher's drain hose underneath the sink, and inspect the <a href=\"https://www.partselect.ca/Dishwasher-Hoses-and-Tubes.htm\" target=\"_blank\">drain hose</a> for any clogs or foreign objects lodged inside.</li>\n<li>Place a large bowl or bucket underneath the drain hose opening and disconnect it from the sink drain. Lift the hose and water should rush into the bucket if there's any left. Then use a drain brush to clean it, or replace it if necessary.</li>\n<li>Reassemble the drain hose and filter assembly, start a cycle, and monitor it for any more stoppages.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Low Water Pressure</h3>\n<p>The pressure of the water being supplied to the dishwasher is important, because if it's too weak it will cause extended filling times and poor cleaning performance. This is why many dishwashers feature sensors that can accurately detect issues with it, and will stop your dishwasher mid-cycle if not enough water is being supplied.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Locate the water supply valves in your home, and inspect its gauge. The reading should be between 14.5 to 80 psi, and a rating over 116 psi would be too high.</li>\n<li>If your water supply doesn't have a gauge, shut the valves closed.</li>\n<li>Unplug your dishwasher.</li>\n<li>Use a screwdriver to unthread the kick plate at the bottom of your dishwasher, and disconnect one of the fill hoses. Expect some water to spill out.</li>\n<li>Put the fill hose into a bowl or large bucket and turn the corresponding water supply valve until it's open.</li>\n<li>If the water strength going into the bowl or bucket is weak, you have an issue with your home's water supply. If the water flow is strong, continue reading this guide.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Power Failure</h3>\n<p>Dishwashers can stop suddenly during a cycle due to power problems, either with your home or the appliance itself. Check your circuit breaker for burn marks, and the dishwasher's power cord for damage like breaks or exposed wires. If necessary, contact an electrician to properly inspect and fix your home's circuit breaker or dishwasher's power cord.</p>\n<h2>What Parts You Need to Replace to Fix a Dishwasher That Stops Mid-Cycle</h2>\n<p>When your dishwasher abruptly stops mid-cycle, it's often due to issues with key parts like the door latch, float switch, heating element and fuse, inlet valves, drain pump, and electronic control board. We'll walk you through how to inspect, test, and replace each of these parts, so you can effectively resolve the mid-cycle stopping problem with your dishwasher.</p>\n<h3>How to Replace a Door Latch to Fix a Dishwasher That Stops Mid-Cycle</h3>\n<p>The door latch assembly is the most common culprit for dishwashers that stop mid-cycle because the door <a href=\"https://www.partselect.com/Dishwasher-Switches.htm\" target=\"_blank\">switch</a>, <a href=\"https://www.partselect.com/Dishwasher-Handles.htm\" target=\"_blank\">handle</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.partselect.com/Dishwasher-Latches.htm\" target=\"_blank\">latch</a> mechanisms ensure the safe and proper operation of the dishwasher. When these parts break or stop working properly, they can cause the dishwasher to stop mid-cycle due to safety triggers that interpret the door as being open. Unless there's a specific code or indication otherwise, a bad door latch assembly in some models is indicated by the dishwasher stopping mid-cycle and blinking its lights. If your door latch assembly is broken or not working, you may also notice it's easy to open, and tough to close fully.</p>\n<p><b>Supplies You'll Need</b></p>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>Philips-head and Flat-head Screwdriver</li>\n<li>Socket Wrench</li>\n<li>Needle-Nose Pliers</li>\n<li>Multimeter</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Step-by-Step Guide:</b></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Shut off the water supply to your dishwasher.</li>\n<li>Use a screwdriver to remove the kickplate at the bottom of your dishwasher.</li>\n<li>Unthread any screws securing your dishwasher below a countertop if necessary, then pull your dishwasher out and unplug it from its wall outlet.</li>\n<li>Locate the door catch on the upper portion of the dishwasher tub. If it's damaged, replace it by unthreading it and disconnecting its wire harness, and securing the new one.</li>\n<li>If the door catch isn't broken, the door switch or latch may be. Start by using a screwdriver to unthread the screws around the dishwasher door's inside perimeter.</li>\n<li>You should now be able to lift and separate the two halves and grab the door switch inside.</li>\n<li>Remove the wire harnesses from the door switch. If you notice any damage to the latch, like cracks or pieces chipped off, replace it immediately.</li>\n<li>Locate the door switch on the assembly, and remove it.

Signs of a specific issue may include blinking lights, or starting and then stopping abruptly when filling. It's normal for dishwashers to pause mid-cycle to drain or heat water up, but there's a distinct difference between pausing and shutting off completely. Resetting your dishwasher or manually activating the drain can resolve it stopping mid-cycle, but the underlying cause must still be fixed, which means inspecting and testing a number of parts. Whether it's a simple fix like a clogged drain filter or a more complex issue like a malfunctioning door latch assembly or control board, this article will guide you through the required supplies, and instructions for diagnosing and fixing your dishwasher if it's stopping in the middle of a cycle. General Problems that Cause a Dishwasher to Stop Mid-Cycle It can be frustrating when your dishwasher stops mid-cycle, but understanding some general problems that can cause it will help you fix it quicker. We'll explore a few common issues, like a clogged filter and drain hose, low water pressure, and power failures, to help you resolve this stopping problem quickly and easily. Clogged Filter and Drain Hose A dishwasher's filter and hose, which are parts of the draining system, are used to trap food particles and debris from harming valuable parts like the pump, and remove dirty water from the dishwasher. If either of these parts is clogged, blocked, or damaged, the dishwasher will stop to avoid any overflow or potential damage to your home or its parts. If you see a series of lights or an error code appear when this occurs, note it and refer to your user manual for further information on the issue. Unplug your dishwasher and turn off its water supply. Open the dishwasher door and remove its filter. This may require a screwdriver or pliers to remove. Inspect the inside of the filter and its housing for any clogs caused by gunk or debris, and use a brush or sponge, and warm soapy water to clean the filter. If the filter is damaged, replace it immediately. Once the filter and its housing are cleaned, locate the dishwasher's drain hose underneath the sink, and inspect the drain hose for any clogs or foreign objects lodged inside. Place a large bowl or bucket underneath the drain hose opening and disconnect it from the sink drain. Lift the hose and water should rush into the bucket if there's any left. Then use a drain brush to clean it, or replace it if necessary. Reassemble the drain hose and filter assembly, start a cycle, and monitor it for any more stoppages. Low Water Pressure The pressure of the water being supplied to the dishwasher is important, because if it's too weak it will cause extended filling times and poor cleaning performance. This is why many dishwashers feature sensors that can accurately detect issues with it, and will stop your dishwasher mid-cycle if not enough water is being supplied. Locate the water supply valves in your home, and inspect its gauge. The reading should be between 14.5 to 80 psi, and a rating over 116 psi would be too high. If your water supply doesn't have a gauge, shut the valves closed. Unplug your dishwasher. Use a screwdriver to unthread the kick plate at the bottom of your dishwasher, and disconnect one of the fill hoses. Expect some water to spill out. Put the fill hose into a bowl or large bucket and turn the corresponding water supply valve until it's open. If the water strength going into the bowl or bucket is weak, you have an issue with your home's water supply. If the water flow is strong, continue reading this guide. Power Failure Dishwashers can stop suddenly during a cycle due to power problems, either with your home or the appliance itself. Check your circuit breaker for burn marks, and the dishwasher's power cord for damage like breaks or exposed wires. If necessary, contact an electrician to properly inspect and fix your home's circuit breaker or dishwasher's power cord. What Parts You Need to Replace to Fix a Dishwasher That Stops Mid-Cycle When your dishwasher abruptly stops mid-cycle, it's often due to issues with key parts like the door latch, float switch, heating element and fuse, inlet valves, drain pump, and electronic control board. We'll walk you through how to inspect, test, and replace each of these parts, so you can effectively resolve the mid-cycle stopping problem with your dishwasher. How to Replace a Door Latch to Fix a Dishwasher That Stops Mid-Cycle The door latch assembly is the most common culprit for dishwashers that stop mid-cycle because the door switch , handle , and latch mechanisms ensure the safe and proper operation of the dishwasher. When these parts break or stop working properly, they can cause the dishwasher to stop mid-cycle due to safety triggers that interpret the door as being open. Unless there's a specific code or indication otherwise, a bad door latch assembly in some models is indicated by the dishwasher stopping mid-cycle and blinking its lights. If your door latch assembly is broken or not working, you may also notice it's easy to open, and tough to close fully. Supplies You'll Need Philips-head and Flat-head Screwdriver Socket Wrench Needle-Nose Pliers Multimeter Step-by-Step Guide: Shut off the water supply to your dishwasher. Use a screwdriver to remove the kickplate at the bottom of your dishwasher. Unthread any screws securing your dishwasher below a countertop if necessary, then pull your dishwasher out and unplug it from its wall outlet. Locate the door catch on the upper portion of the dishwasher tub. If it's damaged, replace it by unthreading it and disconnecting its wire harness, and securing the new one. If the door catch isn't broken, the door switch or latch may be. Start by using a screwdriver to unthread the screws around the dishwasher door's inside perimeter. You should now be able to lift and separate the two halves and grab the door switch inside. Remove the wire harnesses from the door switch. If you notice any damage to the latch, like cracks or pieces chipped off, replace it immediately. Locate the door switch on the assembly, and remove it. Then with a multimeter set to ohms, touch each probe to a terminal on the switch. if you don't hear a beep, the switch does not have continuity and will need replacing. Install the switch into the housing, connect its wire harnesses, and install it within the door assembly. Thread the screws back into the door. Begin to carefully close the door, and monitor your dishwasher to see if the stopping issue is resolved. How to Clean or Replace a Float Switch to Fix a Dishwasher That Stops Mid-Cycle The float switch in your dishwasher is a safety device that detects water levels to prevent overflowing. Over time it can get covered in gunk or stuck, and may not be operable and able to accurately sense the level of water, causing the mid-cycle stops.

If your Frigidaire dishwasher won't drain, it is most likely due to a blocked filter. Other common causes include blockages in the drain pump, drain hose, and garbage disposal, a faulty check valve or drain valve, or an improperly installed air gap. Whether you're a seasoned DIY enthusiast or new to DIY repairs, we'll help you understand how to diagnose and address drainage issues in your Frigidaire dishwasher to save you time, money, and the hassle of dealing with a malfunctioning appliance.</p>\n<h2>Signs Your Frigidaire Dishwasher is Not Draining Properly</h2>\n<ul>\n<b><li>Standing Water:</li></b> If you notice water pooling at the bottom of the dishwasher after a cycle has been completed, this is an indication that the appliance isn't draining properly.\n<b><li>Foul Odors:</li></b> If water is unable to drain from the dishwasher, bacteria and mold can grow rapidly, leading to unpleasant odors.\n<b><li>Water Backup:</li></b> If there is water backing up into the sink from the dishwasher drain during or after a wash cycle, then this is a sign that the air gap is blocked or there may be an obstruction in the drainage system.\n<b><li>Dirty Dishes:</li></b> If the wastewater produced during cleaning is unable to leave the dishwasher, it will be recirculated onto the dishes. This will leave your dishes with bits of debris on them or white spots. This is most often a sign of a clogged filter.\n<b><li>Slow Drainage:</li></b> If you notice that the water takes longer than usual to drain from the dishwasher, it could indicate a partial blockage in the drain system.\n<b><li>Unusual Noises:</li></b> A gurgling or humming sound coming from the dishwasher during the drain cycle can indicate a drainage issue, potentially caused by a clog.\n<b><li>Error Codes:</li></b> If your dishwasher displays the i20, i40, or iF0 error codes, this is an indication that there is a problem with the drain line or filter that is preventing water from flowing freely. You can check your dishwasher's manual for information on interpreting error codes.\n</ul>\n<h2>How a Clogged Frigidaire Dishwasher Filter Causes Poor Drainage</h2>\n<p>The dishwasher filter is a component designed to catch food particles, debris, and other solid materials during the wash cycle to prevent them from recirculating onto dishes and clogging the dishwasher's pump or drain. A clogged filter is the most common cause of drainage issues. If the filter is blocked with food debris and other particles, water will be unable to flow out of the dishwasher at the end of the wash cycle. It is recommended to clean the dishwasher filter at least once a month. If the filter is damaged and no longer functioning then it will need to be replaced to fix the drainage problem. You can browse our list of genuine <a href=\"https://www.partselect.com/Frigidaire-Dishwasher-Filters.htm\" target=\"_blank\">OEM Frigidaire dishwasher filters</a> to find the right one for your model.</p>\n<h3>How to Clean a Blocked Filter to Fix Drainage Issues</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Disconnect the dishwasher from the power outlet and turn off the water supply.</li>\n<li>Open the dishwasher door and pull the bottom rack out of the dishwasher.</li>\n<li>Pull off the lower spray arm to access the filter.</li>\n<li>Press down on the locking tab to release the filter.

It is responsible for transporting wastewater out of the dishwasher during the drain cycle. If the drain hose becomes kinked, or clogged with debris, it can obstruct the flow of water, preventing proper drainage from the dishwasher. Additionally, if the drain hose is damaged or cracked, it may leak water, which can also interfere with the dishwasher's ability to drain efficiently.</p>\n<h3>How to Clean a Blocked Drain Hose to Fix Drainage Issues</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Remove the access panel at the bottom of the dishwasher and locate the junction box.</li>\n<li>Note the orientation of the wire harness connected to the junction box and pull the wire connectors off.</li>\n<li>Unthread the screws from the mounting brackets that secure the dishwasher inside the cabinet opening.</li>\n<li>Locate the drain hose on your dishwasher. It's usually located at the back of the dishwasher, leading from the dishwasher tub to either the sink drain or garbage disposal.</li>\n<li>Pull the dishwasher forward to access the back of the appliance, where the drain hose is connected.</li>\n<li>Check that the hose is free of any kinks, twists, or sharp bends. If none are present, you will need to check the hose for obstructions.</li>\n<li>Disconnect the drain hose from the pump and the kitchen sink drain.</li>\n<li>Inspect the drain hose for any visible clogs or debris. Run high-pressure water through the hose to dislodge any stuck debris.</li>\n<li>If there are still clogs, you can use a long, flexible brush to gently scrub the inside of the hose. Make sure to use a brush that won't damage the hose material.</li>\n<li>Once the hose is clean, reconnect it to the dishwasher and the sink drain or garbage disposal. Make sure all connections are secure to prevent leaks.</li>\n<li>After reassembly, run a test cycle on your dishwasher to ensure everything is working properly and there are no leaks.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How a Blocked Frigidaire Dishwasher Drain Pump Causes Poor Drainage</h2>\n<p>The drain pump is responsible for pumping water out of the dishwasher during the draining cycle. It typically consists of a motor and impeller that creates suction to remove wastewater from the dishwasher and expel it through the drain hose. If the drain pump becomes clogged with debris, such as food particles or grease, or if it malfunctions due to wear and tear, it can prevent the dishwasher from draining properly. Additionally, if there are issues with the pump's motor or impeller, it may not be able to generate enough suction to effectively remove water from the dishwasher, resulting in standing water at the bottom of the dishwasher at the end of a cycle. You can find the drain pump located at the bottom of the unit.</p>\n<h3>How to Clean a Blocked Drain Pump to Fix Drainage Issues</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Begin by disconnecting the dishwasher from the power source and shutting off the water supply.</li>\n<li>Remove the screws that secure the front access panel at the bottom of the dishwasher.</li>\n<li>Disconnect the power wires connected to the junction box and remove the mounting screws that hold the dishwasher to the cabinet.</li>\n<li>Disconnect the drain hose from the sink drain or garbage disposal.</li>\n<li>Pull out the dishwasher and tip it over so that it is lying on its rear panel.</li>\n<li>Visually inspect the drain pump area for any visible debris or blockages. Remove any large debris you can reach with your fingers or a pair of tweezers.</li>\n<li>Use a screwdriver or pliers to remove any fasteners holding the drain pump in place, then carefully pull the drain pump out of its housing.</li>\n<li>Take a picture of how the wire connectors are routed and disconnect the wire connectors.</li>\n<li>Inspect the impeller for any obstructions or signs of damage.</li>\n<li>Use a soft brush or cloth to clean the impeller and the inside of the pump housing. Ensure that the impeller can spin freely.</li>\n<li>Once you've cleaned the drain pump and removed any blockages, you can reassemble the dishwasher in reverse order.</li>\n<li>Slide the dishwasher back into place, and restore power to the unit.</li>\n<li>Run a short cycle to test if the drain pump is working properly and if the blockage has been cleared.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How a Blocked Dishwasher Garbage Disposal Causes Poor Drainage</h2>\n<p>If you have recently installed the garbage disposal, make sure the knockout plug has been removed from the drain tube. This is often the most common cause of drainage issues in new dishwashers. If the garbage disposal is not new, then it may be blocked. If large amounts of grease, food particles, or other debris are regularly disposed of through the garbage disposal, they can accumulate over time, leading to blockages that affect drainage from both the sink and dishwasher. When you run the dishwasher, water may back up into the dishwasher instead of draining properly. You will need to clear the blockage to fix your dishwasher.</p>\n<h3>How to Clean a Blocked Garbage Disposal to Fix Drainage Issues</h3>\n<ul>\n<b><li>Use pliers or tongs:</li></b> Using a pair of pliers to keep your hands safe from the blades, reach into the disposal opening and remove any obstructions. You can also use a flashlight to get a better view.\n<b><li>Use a plunger:</li></b> If you notice standing water in the sink as well, you can use a plunger to release any stuck debris. Place the plunger over the disposal drain and plunge up and down in quick succession to build up water pressure and loosen the debris. Flush the drain and get rid of any lingering waste.\n<b><li>Use a cleaner tablet:</li></b> You can purchase a drain cleaning tablet from your local hardware store and place it inside the disposal to get rid of any stubborn residue. Be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions for the best results.\n</ul>\n<h2>How a Clogged Dishwasher Air Gap Causes Poor Drainage </h2>\n<p>An air gap is a device used in many plumbing systems to prevent dirty water from the sink from backing up into the dishwasher. It's essentially a small, vented cylinder mounted above the sink that allows air to flow into the dishwasher drain line, preventing a vacuum from forming and interfering with drainage. If the air gap becomes clogged with debris such as food particles, grease, or soap scum, water will be unable to drain out of the dishwasher. Additionally, if the air gap is not installed correctly or is installed at an incorrect height, it can lead to drainage problems. For example, if the air gap is installed too low, it may not provide enough clearance for proper drainage, causing water to back up into the dishwasher. </p>\n<h3>How to Clean the Air Gap to Fix Drainage Issues</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Remove the cover from the air gap by simply lifting it or twisting it off. </li>\n<li>Inspect the inside of the air gap for any debris or buildup and use a small brush or a pipe cleaner, to clean out any debris. \n<li>Use a mixture of warm water and mild dish soap to remove any stubborn residue.</li>\n<li>Check the hose from the air gap to the sink drain or garbage disposal to make sure it is not clogged. Flush it with high-pressure water to clear out any debris.</li>\n<li>Inspect the vent and diverter inside the air gap to ensure they are working properly.</li>\n<li>Check that the air gap is installed at least 1 inch above the flood level rim to ensure proper operation. The flood level is typically at the top of the sink basin or slightly below the rim. You can check your local plumbing codes to determine the specific height requirements for air gap installations.</li>\n<li>Once the air gap is clean and correctly positioned, you can reattach the cover and check that the dishwasher is functioning properly.</li>\n</li></ol>\n<h2>How a Faulty Frigidaire Dishwasher Check Valve Causes Poor Drainage</h2>\n<p>The check valve is a small mechanical device that helps to prevent water from flowing back into the dishwasher after it has been drained. A common check valve problem is when the valve gets stuck in a closed position, resulting in draining problems. The check valve can also wear out over time or become damaged. If the valve becomes cracked, broken, or otherwise compromised, it will be able to function properly, resulting in drainage problems.</p>\n<h3>How to Clean and Replace the Check Valve to Fix Drainage Issues</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Remove the lower access panel or kickplate to access the valve.</li>\n<li>You can typically find the check valve in the outlet of the drain pump. Refer to your dishwasher's manual for specific information on your model.</li>\n<li>Inspect the check valve for any signs of damage, such as cracks or breaks, or any debris that may be blocking the valve. </li>\n<li>Use a screwdriver or pliers to remove any fasteners that hold the valve in place. </li>\n<li>If the check valve is dirty or clogged with debris, clean it thoroughly using warm, soapy water and a soft brush. Ensure that all dirt and debris are removed from both the valve and its housing.</li>\n<li>If the check valve is damaged and cannot be repaired, you'll need to replace it with a new one.</li>\n<li>Once the new check valve is installed (or the old one is cleaned and reattached), reattach the lower access panel. </li>\n<li>Reconnect the dishwasher to the power outlet and run a short cycle to test if the check valve is functioning properly.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How a Faulty Frigidaire Drain Solenoid Kit and Drain Valve Causes Poor Drainage</h2>\n<p>The drain solenoid kit is a component responsible for controlling the opening and closing of the drain valve, which allows water to flow out of the dishwasher during the drainage cycle. If the drain solenoid becomes faulty or malfunctions, it can prevent the drain valve from opening fully or at all, leading to improper drainage. If the drain valve itself is clogged with debris or damaged it will be unable to open and close as needed. This can result in standing water at the bottom of the dishwasher, incomplete drainage of water during the cycle, and potential backups in the sink. Take advantage of our model search feature to find a replacement <a href=\"https://www.partselect.com/Dishwasher-Valves.htm\" target=\"_blank\">OEM Frigidaire drain valve</a> for your dishwasher</p>\n<h3>How to Replace Drain Solenoid Kit and Drain Valve to Fix Drainage Issues</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Begin by unplugging the unit from the wall outlet, or flip the appropriate breaker in the circuit breaker panel.</li>\n<li>Access the drain valve by removing the lower kickplate/access panel.

Error Codes: If your dishwasher displays the i20, i40, or iF0 error codes, this is an indication that there is a problem with the drain line or filter that is preventing water from flowing freely. You can check your dishwasher's manual for information on interpreting error codes. How a Clogged Frigidaire Dishwasher Filter Causes Poor Drainage The dishwasher filter is a component designed to catch food particles, debris, and other solid materials during the wash cycle to prevent them from recirculating onto dishes and clogging the dishwasher's pump or drain. A clogged filter is the most common cause of drainage issues. If the filter is blocked with food debris and other particles, water will be unable to flow out of the dishwasher at the end of the wash cycle. It is recommended to clean the dishwasher filter at least once a month. If the filter is damaged and no longer functioning then it will need to be replaced to fix the drainage problem. You can browse our list of genuine OEM Frigidaire dishwasher filters to find the right one for your model. How to Clean a Blocked Filter to Fix Drainage Issues Disconnect the dishwasher from the power outlet and turn off the water supply. Open the dishwasher door and pull the bottom rack out of the dishwasher. Pull off the lower spray arm to access the filter. Press down on the locking tab to release the filter. Pull the filter out of the dishwasher. Carefully remove any large pieces of debris with your fingers and then use warm water and mild dish soap to clean any remaining residue. Thoroughly rinse the filter and wait for it to dry before returning it to the dishwasher. Once dry, reposition the filter inside the dishwasher and ensure it is locked in place. Reconnect the spray arm and slide the lower rack back in place. Reconnect the dishwasher to the power outlet and check that it is now functioning properly. How a Blocked Frigidaire Dishwasher Drain Hose Causes Poor Drainage The drain hose is a flexible tube that connects the dishwasher's drain pump to either the kitchen sink drain or the garbage disposal. It is responsible for transporting wastewater out of the dishwasher during the drain cycle. If the drain hose becomes kinked, or clogged with debris, it can obstruct the flow of water, preventing proper drainage from the dishwasher. Additionally, if the drain hose is damaged or cracked, it may leak water, which can also interfere with the dishwasher's ability to drain efficiently. How to Clean a Blocked Drain Hose to Fix Drainage Issues Remove the access panel at the bottom of the dishwasher and locate the junction box. Note the orientation of the wire harness connected to the junction box and pull the wire connectors off. Unthread the screws from the mounting brackets that secure the dishwasher inside the cabinet opening. Locate the drain hose on your dishwasher. It's usually located at the back of the dishwasher, leading from the dishwasher tub to either the sink drain or garbage disposal. Pull the dishwasher forward to access the back of the appliance, where the drain hose is connected. Check that the hose is free of any kinks, twists, or sharp bends. If none are present, you will need to check the hose for obstructions. Disconnect the drain hose from the pump and the kitchen sink drain. Inspect the drain hose for any visible clogs or debris. Run high-pressure water through the hose to dislodge any stuck debris. If there are still clogs, you can use a long, flexible brush to gently scrub the inside of the hose. Make sure to use a brush that won't damage the hose material. Once the hose is clean, reconnect it to the dishwasher and the sink drain or garbage disposal. Make sure all connections are secure to prevent leaks. After reassembly, run a test cycle on your dishwasher to ensure everything is working properly and there are no leaks. How a Blocked Frigidaire Dishwasher Drain Pump Causes Poor Drainage The drain pump is responsible for pumping water out of the dishwasher during the draining cycle. It typically consists of a motor and impeller that creates suction to remove wastewater from the dishwasher and expel it through the drain hose. If the drain pump becomes clogged with debris, such as food particles or grease, or if it malfunctions due to wear and tear, it can prevent the dishwasher from draining properly. Additionally, if there are issues with the pump's motor or impeller, it may not be able to generate enough suction to effectively remove water from the dishwasher, resulting in standing water at the bottom of the dishwasher at the end of a cycle. You can find the drain pump located at the bottom of the unit. How to Clean a Blocked Drain Pump to Fix Drainage Issues Begin by disconnecting the dishwasher from the power source and shutting off the water supply. Remove the screws that secure the front access panel at the bottom of the dishwasher. Disconnect the power wires connected to the junction box and remove the mounting screws that hold the dishwasher to the cabinet. Disconnect the drain hose from the sink drain or garbage disposal. Pull out the dishwasher and tip it over so that it is lying on its rear panel. Visually inspect the drain pump area for any visible debris or blockages. Remove any large debris you can reach with your fingers or a pair of tweezers. Use a screwdriver or pliers to remove any fasteners holding the drain pump in place, then carefully pull the drain pump out of its housing. Take a picture of how the wire connectors are routed and disconnect the wire connectors. Inspect the impeller for any obstructions or signs of damage. Use a soft brush or cloth to clean the impeller and the inside of the pump housing. Ensure that the impeller can spin freely. Once you've cleaned the drain pump and removed any blockages, you can reassemble the dishwasher in reverse order. Slide the dishwasher back into place, and restore power to the unit. Run a short cycle to test if the drain pump is working properly and if the blockage has been cleared. How a Blocked Dishwasher Garbage Disposal Causes Poor Drainage If you have recently installed the garbage disposal, make sure the knockout plug has been removed from the drain tube. This is often the most common cause of drainage issues in new dishwashers. If the garbage disposal is not new, then it may be blocked. If large amounts of grease, food particles, or other debris are regularly disposed of through the garbage disposal, they can accumulate over time, leading to blockages that affect drainage from both the sink and dishwasher. When you run the dishwasher, water may back up into the dishwasher instead of draining properly. You will need to clear the blockage to fix your dishwasher. How to Clean a Blocked Garbage Disposal to Fix Drainage Issues Use pliers or tongs: Using a pair of pliers to keep your hands safe from the blades, reach into the disposal opening and remove any obstructions. You can also use a flashlight to get a better view. Use a plunger: If you notice standing water in the sink as well, you can use a plunger to release any stuck debris. Place the plunger over the disposal drain and plunge up and down in quick succession to build up water pressure and loosen the debris. Flush the drain and get rid of any lingering waste. Use a cleaner tablet: You can purchase a drain cleaning tablet from your local hardware store and place it inside the disposal to get rid of any stubborn residue. Be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions for the best results. How a Clogged Dishwasher Air Gap Causes Poor Drainage An air gap is a device used in many plumbing systems to prevent dirty water from the sink from backing up into the dishwasher. It's essentially a small, vented cylinder mounted above the sink that allows air to flow into the dishwasher drain line, preventing a vacuum from forming and interfering with drainage. If the air gap becomes clogged with debris such as food particles, grease, or soap scum, water will be unable to drain out of the dishwasher. Additionally, if the air gap is not installed correctly or is installed at an incorrect height, it can lead to drainage problems. For example, if the air gap is installed too low, it may not provide enough clearance for proper drainage, causing water to back up into the dishwasher. How to Clean the Air Gap to Fix Drainage Issues Remove the cover from the air gap by simply lifting it or twisting it off. Inspect the inside of the air gap for any debris or buildup and use a small brush or a pipe cleaner, to clean out any debris. Use a mixture of warm water and mild dish soap to remove any stubborn residue. Check the hose from the air gap to the sink drain or garbage disposal to make sure it is not clogged. Flush it with high-pressure water to clear out any debris. Inspect the vent and diverter inside the air gap to ensure they are working properly. Check that the air gap is installed at least 1 inch above the flood level rim to ensure proper operation. The flood level is typically at the top of the sink basin or slightly below the rim. You can check your local plumbing codes to determine the specific height requirements for air gap installations. Once the air gap is clean and correctly positioned, you can reattach the cover and check that the dishwasher is functioning properly. How a Faulty Frigidaire Dishwasher Check Valve Causes Poor Drainage The check valve is a small mechanical device that helps to prevent water from flowing back into the dishwasher after it has been drained. A common check valve problem is when the valve gets stuck in a closed position, resulting in draining problems. The check valve can also wear out over time or become damaged. If the valve becomes cracked, broken, or otherwise compromised, it will be able to function properly, resulting in drainage problems. How to Clean and Replace the Check Valve to Fix Drainage Issues Remove the lower access panel or kickplate to access the valve. You can typically find the check valve in the outlet of the drain pump. Refer to your dishwasher's manual for specific information on your model. Inspect the check valve for any signs of damage, such as cracks or breaks, or any debris that may be blocking the valve. Use a screwdriver or pliers to remove any fasteners that hold the valve in place. If the check valve is dirty or clogged with debris, clean it thoroughly using warm, soapy water and a soft brush. Ensure that all dirt and debris are removed from both the valve and its housing. If the check valve is damaged and cannot be repaired, you'll need to replace it with a new one. Once the new check valve is installed (or the old one is cleaned and reattached), reattach the lower access panel. Reconnect the dishwasher to the power outlet and run a short cycle to test if the check valve is functioning properly. How a Faulty Frigidaire Drain Solenoid Kit and Drain Valve Causes Poor Drainage The drain solenoid kit is a component responsible for controlling the opening and closing of the drain valve, which allows water to flow out of the dishwasher during the drainage cycle. If the drain solenoid becomes faulty or malfunctions, it can prevent the drain valve from opening fully or at all, leading to improper drainage. If the drain valve itself is clogged with debris or damaged it will be unable to open and close as needed. This can result in standing water at the bottom of the dishwasher, incomplete drainage of water during the cycle, and potential backups in the sink. Take advantage of our model search feature to find a replacement OEM Frigidaire drain valve for your dishwasher How to Replace Drain Solenoid Kit and Drain Valve to Fix Drainage Issues Begin by unplugging the unit from the wall outlet, or flip the appropriate breaker in the circuit breaker panel.

Take your time and be careful not to damage the bin. Control/Shutoff Arm is Not Engaged: The ice maker control arm senses the amount of ice in the ice bin. Once the bin is full, the arm is pushed upwards to turn off the ice maker. The arm may become stuck in this position. Simply, lower the arm to to continue producing ice. How to Replace a Bosch Door Seal A defective door seal can allow warm air to enter the refrigerator, causing temperature fluctuations. This can affect the ice maker's ability to freeze water properly and result in less or no ice production. Prepare the new seal by soaking it in warm water to make it more pliable and easier to work with. Carefully peel back the old door seal from the refrigerator door. You may need to use a putty knife or a flathead screwdriver to help loosen it. Remove any dirt, debris, or adhesive residue on the surface of the door to ensure a proper seal with the new gasket. Begin by positioning the new door seal at one corner of the refrigerator door. Press the seal firmly into place along the entire perimeter of the door, ensuring that it sits flush and snugly against the door surface. Once the new seal is installed, close the refrigerator door and check for any gaps or unevenness. Adjust the seal as needed to ensure a tight seal. Give the new door seal some time to settle and conform to the shape of the refrigerator door. This may take a few hours. How to Fix a Frozen Bosch Water Supply Line Your ice maker needs water in order to function properly. A clogged water line will restrict the amount of water that can reach the ice maker, inhibiting ice production. You should also check that the water line is free of any kinks or sharp bends and that it is properly connected to avoid any leaking. Start by unplugging the refrigerator from the power outlet and turning off the water supply. Locate the water supply line at the back of the refrigerator. Inspect the water supply line for any visible obstructions or ice buildup. Thaw the line using a hair dryer set to low or medium heat. Be careful not to apply too much heat, as excessive heat can damage the line. You can also wrap warm towels around the frozen section of the water supply line. Allow the towels to sit for a while to gradually thaw the ice. After you've successfully thawed the water supply line, plug the refrigerator back in and test the ice maker and water dispenser to ensure they're working properly. To prevent the water supply line from freezing again in the future, consider adjusting the temperature settings in your refrigerator or improving the insulation around the water supply line. How to Replace a Bosch Clogged Water Filter The water filter traps debris and contaminants and keeps your water fresh and clean. If the water filter is clogged, it can restrict water flow to the ice maker, resulting in reduced or no ice production. It is recommended to replace your filter every six months for optimal efficiency. You can use our Bosch Water Filter Finder to find the right filter for your refrigerator model. Depending on your refrigerator model, you can find the water filter in the upper corner of the refrigerator compartment, behind a drop-down panel, or at the bottom of the appliance, behind the grille. Twist the filter out and discard it. Place the new filter into the filter house and turn it clockwise until it is locked in place. Turn on the water supply (if you turned it off) and check for any leaks around the water filter or filter housing. Tighten connections if necessary. How to Replace a Bosch Door Switch The door switch detects when the refrigerator door is closed. If the door switch is defective or malfunctioning, it may not signal the ice maker to start the ice-making cycle when the door is closed, resulting in no ice production. Unplug the refrigerator from the power outlet to ensure safety during the replacement process. You can find the door switch near the top of the refrigerator compartment along the internal frame. Remove any covers or panels to access it. Disconnect the wires harness attached to it. Take note of the wire positions or take a photo for reference when installing the new switch. Inspect the switch for physical damage and if none is present, use a multimeter to test the switch for continuity. If the switch is faulty, remove and discard it. Position the new switch in the same place and reconnect the wires to the appropriate using your notes or reference photo if needed. Secure the switch in place using screws or clips, ensuring it is properly aligned and seated. Reassemble any covers or panels, that you had removed and reconnect the fridge to the power outlet. Close and open the refrigerator door to check if the new switch activates the interior light as expected. How to Replace a Bosch Water Inlet Valve The water inlet valve controls the flow of water into the refrigerator and ice maker. If the valve is faulty or malfunctioning, it may not supply water to the ice maker properly, resulting in difficulties in producing and dispensing ice. Unplug the refrigerator from the power outlet to prevent electrical shock and turn off the water supply to the refrigerator. Locate the water inlet valve at the back of the refrigerator and remove any covers or panels necessary to access the valve. Disconnect the water supply line connected to the valve. You may need to use an adjustable wrench to loosen the compression fitting or connector. Use your phone to take note of how the wire connectors are routed and disconnect the wire connectors. Remove the mounting screw that holds the valve in place and carefully pull the old valve out of the fridge. The water inlet valve is typically held in place by one or more mounting screws. Remove these screws using a screwdriver. Align the new valve with the mounting hole and secure it in place. Attach the wire connectors to the appropriate terminals and reconnect the water supply line to the new valve. ensuring they are securely attached. Turn on the water supply to the refrigerator and check for any leaks around the connections. Reassemble the refrigerator and reconnect it to the power outlet. How to Clean Bosch Condensor Coils Dirty condenser coils can cause the refrigerator's cooling system to work inefficiently, resulting in higher temperatures. If the refrigerator is not maintaining the proper temperature, it may impact the ice maker's ability to freeze water effectively. Before starting, unplug the refrigerator from the power outlet to prevent electrical shock. You can find the condenser coils are located at the bottom of the refrigerator behind an access panel. either at the front or at the back of the fridge. If the coils are located at the back of the refrigerator, you may need to move the refrigerator away from the wall to access them. Check the condenser coils for dirt, dust, and debris buildup. If they are visibly dirty or clogged, they need to be cleaned. Use a vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment or a soft-bristle brush to gently remove the dirt and debris from the coils. Carefully vacuum or brush in the direction of the coil fins to avoid bending or damaging them. For stubborn dirt or debris you can purchase coil cleaner from your local hardware store. Follow the manufacturer's directions for using the cleaner. Once the coils are clean and dry, reattach the access panel and plug the refrigerator back in It's recommended to clean the condenser coils at least once or twice a year to maintain optimal refrigerator performance. How to Replace a Bosch Ice Mold Thermostat The ice mold thermostat monitors the temperature of the ice maker mold. If the thermostat is defective, it may not signal the ice maker to release the ice cubes once they are frozen, resulting in a lack of ice production. Before starting any repair work, ensure that the refrigerator is unplugged from the power outlet to prevent electrical shock. Locate the ice mold thermostat. It is typically mounted on or near the ice mold itself. Carefully disconnect any electrical connectors attached to the ice mold thermostat. Remove any fasteners holding the thermostat in place and gently pull it out of its mounting position. Take the new ice mold thermostat and position it in the same location. Secure the new thermostat in place using any screws or clips you removed earlier. Reconnect any electrical connectors to the new thermostat, ensuring they are firmly attached. If you removed the entire ice maker assembly, carefully reinstall it back into the freezer compartment according to the manufacturer's instructions. Once the ice mold thermostat is replaced and the ice maker assembly is reinstalled, plug the refrigerator back into the power outlet. Test the ice maker to ensure that it cycles properly and produces ice as expected. How to Replace a Bosch Ice Level Control Board The ice level control board is a component that monitors and controls the ice production and storage process. It's responsible for managing the operation of the ice maker, ensuring that the ice bin doesn't overflow with ice and that the ice maker produces ice as needed. it can regulate the ice maker's operation, such as controlling the ice maker's water valve to refill the ice tray or stopping the ice production when the bin is full. If the ice maker is not producing enough ice then you will need to inspect and replace the board if necessary. Before beginning any work, unplug the refrigerator from the power outlet or turn off its circuit breaker to ensure your safety. Depending on your refrigerator model, you may need to remove the ice maker assembly from the freezer compartment to access the control board. This often involves removing screws or clips that secure the ice maker in place. Once you have access to the ice maker assembly, locate the control board. It's typically situated behind a cover or housing within the ice maker assembly. Carefully disconnect any wiring harnesses or connectors attached to the control board. These connectors can usually be removed by gently pressing down on a tab or lever while pulling the connector away from the board. After disconnecting the wiring, remove any screws or fasteners securing the control board to the ice maker assembly. Once the screws are removed, carefully lift out the old control board. Position the new control board in place and secure it with the screws or fasteners you removed earlier. Reconnect the wiring harnesses or connectors to the appropriate terminals on the new control board. Ensure that each connector is securely attached. If you removed the ice maker assembly from the freezer compartment, reinstall it by reversing the steps you took to remove it. Plug the refrigerator back in or turn on its circuit breaker. Allow the ice maker to power on, and then test its functionality to ensure that the new control board is working correctly. If you're uncomfortable performing these steps yourself, it's best to consult a professional technician or contact Bosch customer service for assistance. How to Replace a Bosch Ice Maker Assembly If the green light on your ice maker is flashing, this is an indication that the assembly needs to be replaced. Additionally, if you have inspected all the other parts in your ice maker and you are still unable to produce any ice then you'll likely need to replace the ice maker assembly to continue producing ice. Unplug the refrigerator from the power outlet or turn off its circuit breaker to ensure safety. Turn off the water inlet valve and disconnect the water supply line. Locate the ice maker assembly inside the freezer compartment of your fridge. Use a screwdriver or the appropriate tool to remove any fasteners holding the ice maker in place and carefully pull the ice maker assembly out of its housing. Gently pull off the wire harness that connects the ice maker to the fridge. Position the new ice maker in place, ensuring that it aligns properly with the mounting holes or brackets. If your new ice maker has an electrical connection, such as a wiring harness, reconnect it to the refrigerator. Use screws, clips, or brackets to secure the new ice maker assembly in place. Make sure it is firmly attached to the refrigerator. Reconnect the water supply line to the new ice maker. Ensure that the connection is secure and leak-free. Plug the refrigerator back into the power outlet or turn on its circuit breaker to restore power. Allow the new ice maker to cycle and produce ice before you attempt to use the ice maker. How to Reset Bosch Refrigerator Your ice maker problems may be due to a minor controls board glitch or temporary system error. Resetting your appliance can help with problems like unresponsive controls, low ice production, ice cubes not dispensing properly, or the ice maker not responding to commands. Each refrigerator may have its own resetting protocols, however, you can use this general guide as it is relevant to most models of Bosch refrigerators. If your model has a \"Reset\" button on the control panel, press and hold this button until you hear a chime. If there is no button you can simply unplug the refrigerator from the power outlet or turn off the circuit breaker for the fridge and wait 3 - 5 minutes. It can be very frustrating when your ice maker isn't working. However, if you follow the instructions laid out in this guide you should be able to restore your ice maker in no time. Remember that if you are unsure about any steps during the repair, you should not hesitate to seek professional assistance if needed. By giving your Bosch refrigerator proper care and maintenance, your ice maker can continue to provide convenience and refreshment for years to come.",

We'll explain what could be going on within your refrigerator or the outlet it's plugged into, and we'll explain exactly how to identify which problem you're dealing with. This troubleshooting guide will take your through all of the possible problems and issues, and will ultimately help you get your refrigerator running again.</p>\n<h2>What You Need to Know about Electrical Circuits</h2>\n<p>The first step in understanding the why your refrigerator is tripping your circuit breaker is having a solid understanding of each of the affected components that we'll be talking about in this guide. The following is a glossary of parts and terms to provide you with the knowledge you need to get to work.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Circuit</b>: A closed path that allows electricity to flow from one point to another.</li>\n<li><b>Circuit Breaker</b>: A safety device designed to interrupt and protect an electrical circuit within equipment and prevent the risk of fire. The breakers within a circuit can be reset to continue the flow of electricity.</li>\n<li><b>Fuse</b>: A closed path device that allows electricity to flow between two points, but will break and need replacing after one surge or trip.</li>\n<li><b>Fuse Box/Breaker Panel/Junction Box</b>: A electrical panel that contains either fuses or circuit breakers for a building. They are designed to provide protection to individual power circuits from being overloaded or shorting to the ground.</li>\n<li><b>Wire Harness</b>: An assembly of cables which transmit electrical power.</li>\n<li><b>Wall Outlet</b>: An electrical socket that connects an electrical device to an electricity supply.</li>\n<li><b>Multimeter</b>: An instrument for measuring electrical properties, like voltage, resistance, and current.</li>\n<li><b>Circuit Tripping</b>: When a circuit breaker detects an electrical issue, like an overload or short, and interrupts the flow of electricity to protect the circuit.</li>\n<li><b>GFCI Outlet</b>: Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) outlets are an advanced safety device made to monitor and protect a circuit from water or dampness.</li>\n<li><b>AFCI Outlet</b>: Arc Fault Circuit Interrupter (AFCI) outlets are electrical devices designed to protect a circuit from electrical fires that stem from arcing faults (discharge of electricity between two conductors).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Why is My Refrigerator Tripping the Breaker?</h2>\n<p>The simplest and most common reason a refrigerator, or any appliance, would trip a circuit breaker or fuse box is because it's overloading the overall circuit. Overloading a circuit or fuse means that one appliance or device is drawing too much power it at one given time, compared to the rated capacity of the circuit or fuse. Normally when wiring homes, refrigerators are put on their own designated outlet due to the amount of power they pull, in an effort to curb this from happening. Manufacturers even state that a refrigerator must be on its own independent household circuit, so no other appliance or electrical device should be on the same circuit.</p>\n<p>But there are other reasons why a circuit trips, such as faulty wiring from the outlet itself or the refrigerator connected to it, or if an older model refrigerator simply loses its power efficiency over time.</p>\n<h2>How To Find Out if Your Refrigerator is Tripping the Breaker</h2>\n<p>When starting a repair journey like this, it's important to exercise caution whenever dealing with parts in and outside of your refrigerator, especially anything that has an electric current. Remembering to use proper protective equipment, such as insulated work gloves or safety glasses, is important to your safety and wellbeing, and to the overall result of the repair.</p>\n<h3>Inspect the Wall Outlet</h3>\n<p>The first place to inspect if you suspect your refrigerator is tripping your circuit breaker is the wall outlet. To do this, you will need a voltage tester/multimeter that can display the output of the power at the outlet itself. That way you can find out if the outlet is outputting the proper voltage for the fridge and any other appliances that may be connected.</p>\n<p>When doing this, you should start by looking for visual indications of a problem, specifically signs of arcing or burning around the outlet, because those are clear indications of an issue with the outlet and the power cord of your refrigerator. A worn or defective outlet can cause electricity to arc and potentially burn the outlet, and if there are any damaged or exposed wires on the power cord, the outlet can cause issues with it, too. The <a href=\"https://www.partselect.com/Refrigerator-Power-Cords.htm\" target=\"_blank\">power cord</a> for your refrigerator can be replaced if it is found to be the cause of the refrigerators issue.</p>\n<p>Wall outlets are designed to grip the prongs of the cord, and if the prongs are worn or damaged, that grip is lost. If the connection is loose, eventually it will melt the cord and any other plastic (i.e. the outlet cover) in the process. If the connection is poor enough between the prongs and the outlet, electricity will jump the gap and create a spark or arc, which burns even more and accelerates the failure. Test the voltage coming out of the outlet with a voltage tester to ensure you have the proper level between 110-120V. A low voltage will make starting the motor more difficult and could trop a breaker or fuse.</p>\n<p>If the power cord is severely damaged and wires are exposed, it'll need to be replaced as soon as possible with an OEM cord. To do this, you will need work gloves, and a set of pliers. All you need to do is unplug your fridge and pull it out from the wall until you can access it, then unscrew any cover on the rear of the appliance. Follow the cord to where it connects and remove the clamp securing it. Connect the new one and reinstall the clamp, as well as the rear cover of the fridge, before you plug it back in.</p>\n<h3>Troubleshoot Power Issues With Your Refrigerator</h3>\n<p>If you don't see any issues with your outlet or the surrounding area, it's time to test your refrigerator to see whether the tripping problem is being caused by the appliance. We recommend  testing the defrost timer and run capacitor in your refrigerator as your next steps, because it they are more likely to be causing the problem, than the breaker or fuse in your home. It makes sense to test and rule these out before exploring more serious electrical inspections. To troubleshoot your refrigerator, you will need a clamp multimeter and a line splitting tool to test the current within its power cord.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>First, you will want to move your refrigerator to a different outlet. This can be an outlet nearby,  just as long as your refrigerator is on a different circuit. However, you can also plug your fridge into an extension cord instead of moving it, but the cord needs to be properly rated for 15 or 20A.</li>\n<li>Ensure your refrigerator is plugged in directly to the line splitting tool and turned on.</li>\n<li>Plug the line splitting tool into your home's outlet and set your clamp on multimeter, capable of reading household currents, up with the refrigerator's power cord. A line splitting tool is a device that separates hot from neutral and ground wires, so you can measure the current being drawn.</li>\n<li>Set all temperature settings in the fridge to their lowest (coldest); this is to ensure it does not turn off during testing.</li>\n<li>Using the clamp multimeter, check the current (amperage) being used by the fridge.</li>\n<li>If the current being used by the fridge exceeds 15A, the electrical problem lies within the refrigerator.</li>\n<li>If the current is less than 15A, put your refrigerator into defrosting mode. Models with timers can be advanced to initiate a defrost, whereas electronic control boards will require a specific set of steps to initiate a defrost cycle for testing. Since these steps can vary by make and manufacturer, you will need to find this information in your owner's manual or online.</li>\n<li>Check the current reading again with your multimeter and if it exceeds 15A, the problem is with the fridge.</li>\n<li>If after you've tested the fridge, the current does not exceed 15A, the circuitry issue is with your home. This could be an issue with a weak break, or a worn fuse holder, if your home has screw-in fuses.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How to Fix a Refrigerator that Keeps Shorting</h2>\n<p>For a refrigerator that's pulling too much power from the wall outlet and overloading the circuit, you will need to troubleshoot and potentially replace one of two parts in your fridge; the compressor's run capacitor, or the defrost timer or control board (depending on your fridge model). If your fridge model is from before 2000 you will likely have a defrost timer, if your model is from 2000-2015 you could have either, and if your fridge was made in the last 10 years (2015 onwards), it likely has a defrost unit within the control board. As we explain below, these parts are essential to the overall function of the refrigerator, and when they fail they can cause the trip you are experiencing. We walk you through how to identify which of these parts is causing the problem in your refrigerator, and we explain how to replace them to get your appliance running!</p>\n<h3>How to Replace a Refrigerator's Defrost Timer or Heater</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.partselect.ca/Refrigerator-Timers.htm\" target=\"_blank\">defrost timer and control board</a> and <a href=\"https://www.partselect.ca/Refrigerator-Elements-and-Burners.htm\" target=\"_blank\">heater</a> are, as their name implies, responsible for the cooling and defrosting process of the refrigerator, which are determined either by a length of time, continuous or while the compressor runs, or by the number of times the doors are opened. They're also two of the most common reasons for a fridge to experience a short or interrupted circuit, due to the heater or timer/control board failing and pulling too much power, and overloading and tripping the outlet. Continue reading to find out how to replace or test your defrost timer or heater!</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Unplug your refrigerator from its wall outlet.</li>\n<li>Open your freezer compartment and locate the heater. It's usually behind the back panel of the freezer section.</li>\n<li>Anything in the way will need to be removed, like the food items and contents of your freezer, and parts like the ice maker, and then finally the cover panel. This will all depend on your model and the features it includes.</li>\n<li>Use a screwdriver to unthread any securing screws or clips, and then remove the cover.</li>\n<li>Use a set of pliers to disconnect the wires for the heater.</li>\n<li>Using a multimeter, set it to RX1 and place a lead on each of the terminals. If the reading is zero or infinity, replace it. If not, reinstall it and test your defrost timer instead.</li>\n<li>If your defrost heater was the issue, remove the old one and replace it with the new one, and then carefully reassemble your freezer compartment.</li>\n<li>Then plug your fridge back in and monitor it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><b>If the defrost heater is not the issue, you will need to inspect and potentially replace the defrost timer or control board, depending on your refrigerator model. If your model has a control board instead of a timer, you will need to test the relay board. A relay board will either be built into the back of the fridge (and can only be accessed by pulling the fridge out from the wall) or will be in the same place as the control board.</b></p>\n<ol>\n<li>To find the timer or control board in your fridge you will need to locate the control panel, since these parts are attached to the control panel. Depending on the model, it'll be in a number of places. The most common location for control panels would be in the back of the appliance near the top, or on the ceiling of the fridge compartment, behind the kick plate at the bottom of your fridge, or down by the compressor at the rear of the fridge.</li>\n<li>Use a screwdriver to unthread the control panel and open it.</li>\n<li>Disconnect the wire harness of the control panel to the fridge.</li>\n<li>Use a screwdriver to disconnect the defrost timer and heater from its assembly.</li>\n<li>Whether you have a timer or control board, testing it for continuity is the same. Using a multimeter, set it to the X1 setting for Ohm's and connect a probe to each terminal. If there is no continuity, replace the timer immediately.</li>\n<li>Install the new timer and any wires connected to it.</li>\n<li>Connect the control panel's wire harness to the fridge and rethread the securing screws.</li>\n<li>Plug your fridge back in and monitor it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><b>Note</b>: To ensure that your relay or control board is bad/faulty, have them diagnosed by a qualified technician before purchasing a new one to replace it.</p>\n<h3>How to Replace a Refrigerator Compressor's Capacitor</h3>\n<p>A fridge compressor's <a href=\"https://www.partselect.ca/Refrigerator-Compressors.htm\" target=\"_blank\">capacitor</a>, also known as a relay, is what assists in turning the compressor on and off, depending on the cooling needed. But if the capacitor fails from old age or an electrical surge, it will no longer operate properly and it will overload its outlet, which leads to a short and tripped circuit. If you listen carefully, a failed capacitor will cause the compressor to click when it overloads the circuit. The capacitor will be located at the bottom rear portion of the refrigerator, and can be tested and replaced easily with a set of pliers, screwdriver, wrench, multimeter, and work gloves. Read along and we'll explain exactly how to fix your compressor.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Unplug your refrigerator from the wall outlet.</li>\n<li>Pull your fridge out from the wall, and remove its back panel with a screwdriver or wrench.</li>\n<li>Locate the capacitor and discharge any potentially stored electricity from it. This can be done by putting a metal object, like a screwdriver, across the two terminals of the capacitor.</li>\n<li>Remove any harnesses connected to it with a set of pliers.</li>\n<li>Carefully remove the old capacitor.</li>\n<li>Use a multimeter in Ohms mode to test it for continuity by touching the probes to the terminals. Ideally the resistance will rise and then fall back to zero, but if it rises and stays, the capacitor is shorted. If it does not rise at all, it is open and needs to be replaced.</li>\n<li>To replace it, simply install the new capacitor in the old one's place, and reinstall the wiring harnesses by plugging them onto the capacitor.</li>\n<li>Replace the back panel of the fridge, and plug it back in. Let it run for a few minutes and take note of anything that happens.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Why Your Outlet Keeps Tripping</h2>\n<p>Now that we have ruled out the refrigerator and the outlet it's plugged into, there are a couple more complex issues that could be causing the power to continually trip. We'll walk you through each of those reasons, and what your next steps should be.</p>\n<h3>Improperly Routed Wire Harness</h3>\n<p>Electrical wiring can be complicated, especially for an appliance like a refrigerator. This becomes even more of a nuisance when the problem with an appliance like a refrigerator lies within its wire harnesses. Even though it's a rarity, an incorrectly or improperly routed wire that comes into contact with another wire, can cause one or both to melt and cause a short within the refrigerator's circuit as a result. And in some cases, rodents will find their way into the compressor compartment and chew on the wires, creating a possibility of shorting or overheating. The only way you'd be able to find this issue, however, is by visually inspecting your refrigerator's wires and ensuring such a short does not exist. If you're not comfortable investigating your fridge's circuitry, consider contacting a repair technician to investigate your refrigerator for a short or other issue with its circuitry.</p>\n<h3>Issues with GFCI Outlets</h3>\n<p>Depending on how recently your home was built, a GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter) outlet in your home may be tripping from a grounding issue. A grounding issue, or 'fault', happens when the electrical current from your home follows an unintended path to the ground (i.e. damaged wiring, moisture infiltration, etc.). It's worth noting though, that GFCI outlets are not commonly used for circuits with a fridge because they need to be accessible, so you can quickly and easily access them if they trip. This outlet can be replaced with an AFCI outlet, however, it's important to get a qualified electrician's opinion on your home's electrical layout before doing anything yourself.</p>\n<h2>What to Do if Your Outlet Keeps Tripping</h2>\n<p>If you've inspected your fridge's wiring and your GFCI outlet has no indications of any damage or issue and is still tripping, there are a couple of ways to circumvent your outlet tripping and to get your fridge back and operational again, without needing any tools.</p>\n<h3>Switch the Refrigerator Outlet</h3>\n<p>One proven way to identify any electrical issues you're having with a refrigerator, or any appliance, is to switch its outlet. Whether it's some electrical interference, or if the outlet itself just isn't grabbing and supporting the refrigerator's power cord for any number of reasons, switching the outlet it's plugged into can allow your refrigerator to run, and pinpoint the problem to the outlet itself.</p>\n<h3>Use an Extension Cord</h3>\n<p>Adding on to the idea of switching outlets, if you need an extension cord to reach a different outlet, use one! But make sure of the extension cord's current rating. The cord will need to have a rating for 15 or 20A to handle the electric current from the wall outlet to the refrigerator without issue. If you've been using an extension cord for your refrigerator and it's not rated to handle 15 or 20A, replace it with one that can immediately.

We'll explain what could be going on within your refrigerator or the outlet it's plugged into, and we'll explain exactly how to identify which problem you're dealing with. This troubleshooting guide will take your through all of the possible problems and issues, and will ultimately help you get your refrigerator running again. What You Need to Know about Electrical Circuits The first step in understanding the why your refrigerator is tripping your circuit breaker is having a solid understanding of each of the affected components that we'll be talking about in this guide. The following is a glossary of parts and terms to provide you with the knowledge you need to get to work. Circuit : A closed path that allows electricity to flow from one point to another. Circuit Breaker : A safety device designed to interrupt and protect an electrical circuit within equipment and prevent the risk of fire. The breakers within a circuit can be reset to continue the flow of electricity. Fuse : A closed path device that allows electricity to flow between two points, but will break and need replacing after one surge or trip. Fuse Box/Breaker Panel/Junction Box : A electrical panel that contains either fuses or circuit breakers for a building. They are designed to provide protection to individual power circuits from being overloaded or shorting to the ground. Wire Harness : An assembly of cables which transmit electrical power. Wall Outlet : An electrical socket that connects an electrical device to an electricity supply. Multimeter : An instrument for measuring electrical properties, like voltage, resistance, and current. Circuit Tripping : When a circuit breaker detects an electrical issue, like an overload or short, and interrupts the flow of electricity to protect the circuit. GFCI Outlet : Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) outlets are an advanced safety device made to monitor and protect a circuit from water or dampness. AFCI Outlet : Arc Fault Circuit Interrupter (AFCI) outlets are electrical devices designed to protect a circuit from electrical fires that stem from arcing faults (discharge of electricity between two conductors). Why is My Refrigerator Tripping the Breaker? The simplest and most common reason a refrigerator, or any appliance, would trip a circuit breaker or fuse box is because it's overloading the overall circuit. Overloading a circuit or fuse means that one appliance or device is drawing too much power it at one given time, compared to the rated capacity of the circuit or fuse. Normally when wiring homes, refrigerators are put on their own designated outlet due to the amount of power they pull, in an effort to curb this from happening. Manufacturers even state that a refrigerator must be on its own independent household circuit, so no other appliance or electrical device should be on the same circuit. But there are other reasons why a circuit trips, such as faulty wiring from the outlet itself or the refrigerator connected to it, or if an older model refrigerator simply loses its power efficiency over time. How To Find Out if Your Refrigerator is Tripping the Breaker When starting a repair journey like this, it's important to exercise caution whenever dealing with parts in and outside of your refrigerator, especially anything that has an electric current. Remembering to use proper protective equipment, such as insulated work gloves or safety glasses, is important to your safety and wellbeing, and to the overall result of the repair. Inspect the Wall Outlet The first place to inspect if you suspect your refrigerator is tripping your circuit breaker is the wall outlet. To do this, you will need a voltage tester/multimeter that can display the output of the power at the outlet itself. That way you can find out if the outlet is outputting the proper voltage for the fridge and any other appliances that may be connected. When doing this, you should start by looking for visual indications of a problem, specifically signs of arcing or burning around the outlet, because those are clear indications of an issue with the outlet and the power cord of your refrigerator. A worn or defective outlet can cause electricity to arc and potentially burn the outlet, and if there are any damaged or exposed wires on the power cord, the outlet can cause issues with it, too. The power cord for your refrigerator can be replaced if it is found to be the cause of the refrigerators issue. Wall outlets are designed to grip the prongs of the cord, and if the prongs are worn or damaged, that grip is lost. If the connection is loose, eventually it will melt the cord and any other plastic (i.e. the outlet cover) in the process. If the connection is poor enough between the prongs and the outlet, electricity will jump the gap and create a spark or arc, which burns even more and accelerates the failure. Test the voltage coming out of the outlet with a voltage tester to ensure you have the proper level between 110-120V. A low voltage will make starting the motor more difficult and could trop a breaker or fuse. If the power cord is severely damaged and wires are exposed, it'll need to be replaced as soon as possible with an OEM cord. To do this, you will need work gloves, and a set of pliers. All you need to do is unplug your fridge and pull it out from the wall until you can access it, then unscrew any cover on the rear of the appliance. Follow the cord to where it connects and remove the clamp securing it. Connect the new one and reinstall the clamp, as well as the rear cover of the fridge, before you plug it back in. Troubleshoot Power Issues With Your Refrigerator If you don't see any issues with your outlet or the surrounding area, it's time to test your refrigerator to see whether the tripping problem is being caused by the appliance. We recommend testing the defrost timer and run capacitor in your refrigerator as your next steps, because it they are more likely to be causing the problem, than the breaker or fuse in your home. It makes sense to test and rule these out before exploring more serious electrical inspections. To troubleshoot your refrigerator, you will need a clamp multimeter and a line splitting tool to test the current within its power cord. First, you will want to move your refrigerator to a different outlet. This can be an outlet nearby, just as long as your refrigerator is on a different circuit. However, you can also plug your fridge into an extension cord instead of moving it, but the cord needs to be properly rated for 15 or 20A. Ensure your refrigerator is plugged in directly to the line splitting tool and turned on. Plug the line splitting tool into your home's outlet and set your clamp on multimeter, capable of reading household currents, up with the refrigerator's power cord. A line splitting tool is a device that separates hot from neutral and ground wires, so you can measure the current being drawn. Set all temperature settings in the fridge to their lowest (coldest); this is to ensure it does not turn off during testing. Using the clamp multimeter, check the current (amperage) being used by the fridge. If the current being used by the fridge exceeds 15A, the electrical problem lies within the refrigerator. If the current is less than 15A, put your refrigerator into defrosting mode. Models with timers can be advanced to initiate a defrost, whereas electronic control boards will require a specific set of steps to initiate a defrost cycle for testing. Since these steps can vary by make and manufacturer, you will need to find this information in your owner's manual or online. Check the current reading again with your multimeter and if it exceeds 15A, the problem is with the fridge. If after you've tested the fridge, the current does not exceed 15A, the circuitry issue is with your home. This could be an issue with a weak break, or a worn fuse holder, if your home has screw-in fuses. How to Fix a Refrigerator that Keeps Shorting For a refrigerator that's pulling too much power from the wall outlet and overloading the circuit, you will need to troubleshoot and potentially replace one of two parts in your fridge; the compressor's run capacitor, or the defrost timer or control board (depending on your fridge model). If your fridge model is from before 2000 you will likely have a defrost timer, if your model is from 2000-2015 you could have either, and if your fridge was made in the last 10 years (2015 onwards), it likely has a defrost unit within the control board. As we explain below, these parts are essential to the overall function of the refrigerator, and when they fail they can cause the trip you are experiencing. We walk you through how to identify which of these parts is causing the problem in your refrigerator, and we explain how to replace them to get your appliance running! How to Replace a Refrigerator's Defrost Timer or Heater The defrost timer and control board and heater are, as their name implies, responsible for the cooling and defrosting process of the refrigerator, which are determined either by a length of time, continuous or while the compressor runs, or by the number of times the doors are opened. They're also two of the most common reasons for a fridge to experience a short or interrupted circuit, due to the heater or timer/control board failing and pulling too much power, and overloading and tripping the outlet. Continue reading to find out how to replace or test your defrost timer or heater! Unplug your refrigerator from its wall outlet. Open your freezer compartment and locate the heater. It's usually behind the back panel of the freezer section. Anything in the way will need to be removed, like the food items and contents of your freezer, and parts like the ice maker, and then finally the cover panel. This will all depend on your model and the features it includes. Use a screwdriver to unthread any securing screws or clips, and then remove the cover. Use a set of pliers to disconnect the wires for the heater. Using a multimeter, set it to RX1 and place a lead on each of the terminals. If the reading is zero or infinity, replace it. If not, reinstall it and test your defrost timer instead. If your defrost heater was the issue, remove the old one and replace it with the new one, and then carefully reassemble your freezer compartment. Then plug your fridge back in and monitor it. If the defrost heater is not the issue, you will need to inspect and potentially replace the defrost timer or control board, depending on your refrigerator model. If your model has a control board instead of a timer, you will need to test the relay board. A relay board will either be built into the back of the fridge (and can only be accessed by pulling the fridge out from the wall) or will be in the same place as the control board. To find the timer or control board in your fridge you will need to locate the control panel, since these parts are attached to the control panel. Depending on the model, it'll be in a number of places. The most common location for control panels would be in the back of the appliance near the top, or on the ceiling of the fridge compartment, behind the kick plate at the bottom of your fridge, or down by the compressor at the rear of the fridge. Use a screwdriver to unthread the control panel and open it. Disconnect the wire harness of the control panel to the fridge. Use a screwdriver to disconnect the defrost timer and heater from its assembly. Whether you have a timer or control board, testing it for continuity is the same. Using a multimeter, set it to the X1 setting for Ohm's and connect a probe to each terminal. If there is no continuity, replace the timer immediately. Install the new timer and any wires connected to it. Connect the control panel's wire harness to the fridge and rethread the securing screws. Plug your fridge back in and monitor it. Note : To ensure that your relay or control board is bad/faulty, have them diagnosed by a qualified technician before purchasing a new one to replace it. How to Replace a Refrigerator Compressor's Capacitor A fridge compressor's capacitor , also known as a relay, is what assists in turning the compressor on and off, depending on the cooling needed. But if the capacitor fails from old age or an electrical surge, it will no longer operate properly and it will overload its outlet, which leads to a short and tripped circuit. If you listen carefully, a failed capacitor will cause the compressor to click when it overloads the circuit. The capacitor will be located at the bottom rear portion of the refrigerator, and can be tested and replaced easily with a set of pliers, screwdriver, wrench, multimeter, and work gloves. Read along and we'll explain exactly how to fix your compressor. Unplug your refrigerator from the wall outlet. Pull your fridge out from the wall, and remove its back panel with a screwdriver or wrench. Locate the capacitor and discharge any potentially stored electricity from it. This can be done by putting a metal object, like a screwdriver, across the two terminals of the capacitor. Remove any harnesses connected to it with a set of pliers. Carefully remove the old capacitor. Use a multimeter in Ohms mode to test it for continuity by touching the probes to the terminals. Ideally the resistance will rise and then fall back to zero, but if it rises and stays, the capacitor is shorted. If it does not rise at all, it is open and needs to be replaced. To replace it, simply install the new capacitor in the old one's place, and reinstall the wiring harnesses by plugging them onto the capacitor. Replace the back panel of the fridge, and plug it back in. Let it run for a few minutes and take note of anything that happens. Why Your Outlet Keeps Tripping Now that we have ruled out the refrigerator and the outlet it's plugged into, there are a couple more complex issues that could be causing the power to continually trip. We'll walk you through each of those reasons, and what your next steps should be. Improperly Routed Wire Harness Electrical wiring can be complicated, especially for an appliance like a refrigerator. This becomes even more of a nuisance when the problem with an appliance like a refrigerator lies within its wire harnesses. Even though it's a rarity, an incorrectly or improperly routed wire that comes into contact with another wire, can cause one or both to melt and cause a short within the refrigerator's circuit as a result. And in some cases, rodents will find their way into the compressor compartment and chew on the wires, creating a possibility of shorting or overheating. The only way you'd be able to find this issue, however, is by visually inspecting your refrigerator's wires and ensuring such a short does not exist. If you're not comfortable investigating your fridge's circuitry, consider contacting a repair technician to investigate your refrigerator for a short or other issue with its circuitry. Issues with GFCI Outlets Depending on how recently your home was built, a GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter) outlet in your home may be tripping from a grounding issue. A grounding issue, or 'fault', happens when the electrical current from your home follows an unintended path to the ground (i.e. damaged wiring, moisture infiltration, etc.). It's worth noting though, that GFCI outlets are not commonly used for circuits with a fridge because they need to be accessible, so you can quickly and easily access them if they trip. This outlet can be replaced with an AFCI outlet, however, it's important to get a qualified electrician's opinion on your home's electrical layout before doing anything yourself. What to Do if Your Outlet Keeps Tripping If you've inspected your fridge's wiring and your GFCI outlet has no indications of any damage or issue and is still tripping, there are a couple of ways to circumvent your outlet tripping and to get your fridge back and operational again, without needing any tools. Switch the Refrigerator Outlet One proven way to identify any electrical issues you're having with a refrigerator, or any appliance, is to switch its outlet. Whether it's some electrical interference, or if the outlet itself just isn't grabbing and supporting the refrigerator's power cord for any number of reasons, switching the outlet it's plugged into can allow your refrigerator to run, and pinpoint the problem to the outlet itself. Use an Extension Cord Adding on to the idea of switching outlets, if you need an extension cord to reach a different outlet, use one! But make sure of the extension cord's current rating. The cord will need to have a rating for 15 or 20A to handle the electric current from the wall outlet to the refrigerator without issue. If you've been using an extension cord for your refrigerator and it's not rated to handle 15 or 20A, replace it with one that can immediately. Using an extension cord with too low of an amperage compared to the amperage necessary for the appliance will cause an overload, and lead to the outlet tripping and potentially causing a fire. Now that your refrigerator is fully back and operational, hopefully you can get back to being able to properly store your food and keep it fresh for longer, without the worry of your fridge turning off or circuit tripping.

This error may be displayed as E1 on certain models of LG dishwashers. It may be triggered by a faulty sensor, however it is commonly caused by using too much or incorrect detergent, a control board glitch, a worn-down door gasket, a faulty spray arm, or a faulty water inlet valve. This repair guide is designed to help you find the cause of the issue and troubleshoot it to clear the code and restore your LG dishwasher.</p>\n<h2>How Using Detergent Incorrectly Can Cause the AE Error</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Use one dishwasher pod per cycle:</b> Your LG dishwasher is designed to use one pod at a time. Using more than one pod can lead to overflow and leaking, resulting in the AE error. </li>\n<li><b>Use the correct amount of detergent:</b> Ensure that you are following the marked levels for correct amount of detergent to use otherwise you will have excessive suds and cause water to overflow, resulting in the AE error. In LG dishwashers, you should use the 15 Line for slightly dirty loads and the 25 Line for very dirty dishes with stuck-on food.</li>\n<li><b>Do not use dishwashing liquid:</b> It may be tempting to reach for dishwashing liquid when you are out of pods/tablets, however, dishwashers are not designed for this. Using dishwashing liquid can lead to excessive suds and leaking. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How an LG Dishwasher That is Not Level Cause the AE Error</h2>\n<p>If your dishwasher is not level, water will not drain from the appliance. This can lead to overflow and leaking which triggers the AE error. Your dishwasher must be level for it to function properly. You can check whether it is level by placing a bubble level on the dishwasher door. The bubble should be centred within the lines and if it is not that is a signal that the appliance is not level. You can also pour water on the bottom of the dishwasher and check whether it pools to one side. If it does, this is also a signal that the washer is not level. To balance your dishwasher, you should firstly make sure that it is resting on a flat, even surface. If this does not resolve the issue, you will need to adjust the levelling legs which are found on the underside of the appliance. Turn the legs clockwise to raise their height and counterclockwise to lower them. </p>\n<h2>How a Faulty LG Dishwasher Door Gasket can Cause the AE Error</h2>\n<p>The door gasket is responsible for creating a watertight seal between the dishwasher door and tub. It prevents water from leaking out during use. It's typically made of rubber and you can find it around the perimeter of the dishwasher door. Over time, the door gasket may wear out or become damaged. If it has failed, you will need to find a <a href=\"https://www.partselect.com/LG-Dishwasher-Seals-and-Gaskets.htm\" target=\"_blank\">replacement door gasket</a> in order to clear the AE error. It is also possible for food and soap residue to build up on the door gaskets resulting in leakages and thereby causing the AE Error. </p>\n<h3>How to Replace the Door Gasket in Your LG Dishwasher</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Open the dishwasher door and make note of how the old gasket is installed to help you position the new one later.\n<li>Carefully peel off the old gasket from around the perimeter of the dishwasher door. \n<li>Thoroughly clean the area where the old gasket was installed. It may be helpful to use a gentle soap or a mixture of water and vinegar to remove any stubborn residue.</li>\n<li>Starting at one corner, press the new gasket in place, making sure it fits snugly all the way around. If the new gasket seems stiff, you can soak it in warm water for a few minutes before installation to make it softer.</li>\n<li>Make sure the gasket is properly aligned and fully seated against the door.</li>\n<li>Close the dishwasher door and check that it is properly aligned and tightly sealed.</li>\n<li>Plug the dishwasher back into the power supply.</li>\n<li>Run a short test cycle to ensure that the door gasket is working effectively. Check for any leaks during the cycle.</li>\n</li></li></ol>\n<h2>How a Faulty LG Dishwasher Float Sensor can Cause the AE Error</h2>\n<p>The float sensor is designed to monitor and control the water level inside the dishwasher. When you start a wash cycle, the dishwasher begins to fill with water and the float sensor helps monitor this process to avoid overfilling. The float sensor can trigger an alert or shut off the water supply incase of a leak or drainage issue. It is found at the bottom of the dishwasher's tub. Once the float reaches a certain level, the float sensor signals the dishwasher's water inlet valve to stop the flow of water. If it is faulty or damaged the sensor may be unable to detect the correct water levels thus resulting in the AE error.</p>\n<h3>How to Test the Float Sensor </h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Depending on your dishwasher model, you may need to remove the bottom front panel or you may be able to access the float sensor from inside the dishwasher.</li>\n<li>The float sensor is typically a small, plastic device that moves up and down with the water level. It is often located near the front or side of the dishwasher's interior.</li>\n<li>Carefully disconnect any wires connected to the float sensor.</li>\n<li>Set your multimeter to the continuity mode, and touch the multimeter probes to the terminals of the float sensor. </li>\n<li>If the multimeter beeps this indicates that the circuit is closed, and the float sensor is functioning correctly.</li>\n<li>If there is no beep, then the circuit is open, and the float sensor is likely faulty.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>How to Replace the Float Sensor in Your LG Dishwasher</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Unplug the dishwasher from the electrical outlet or turn off the circuit breaker.</li>\n<li>Depending on your dishwasher model, you may need to remove the lower access panel at the front.</li>\n<li>Identify the float sensor and carefully disconnect any wiring or connectors attached to the float sensor. </li>\n<li>Remove any fasteners holding the float sensor in place and gently lift it out.</li>\n<li>Place the new float sensor in the same position as the old one and secure it in place. </li>\n<li>Reconnect any wiring or connectors to the new float sensor.</li>\n<li>Put the lower access panel back in place and secure it with screws.</li>\n<li>Plug the dishwasher back into the electrical outlet or turn the circuit breaker back on.</li>\n<li>Run a test cycle to ensure that the new float sensor is functioning correctly and the AE code has been cleared.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How a Faulty LG Dishwasher Spray Arm can Cause the AE Error</h2>\n<p>The spray arm distributes water throughout the dishwasher to rinse off and remove food particles and debris from the dishes. If the spray arm has any blockages or clogs, it may not distribute water evenly during the wash cycle. This can lead to an imbalance of water within the dishwasher, causing leaks. A damaged or warped spray arm may not spin properly, leading to uneven water distribution. This can result in water pooling in certain areas of the dishwasher, potentially causing leaks. If the spray arm itself has cracks or holes, water may escape from these openings, causing leaks.</p>\n<h3>How to Replace the Spray Arm in an LG Dishwasher</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Begin by disconnecting the dishwasher from the power outlet. </li>\n<li>Open the dishwasher door and pull out the lower rack.</li>\n<li>The spray arm is typically located on the bottom of the dishwasher. </li>\n<li>In some dishwashers the spray arm is secured by a locking mechanism and in others it is a nut. If it has a locking mechanism, release it by turning it counterclockwise. If there is a nut, use the appropriate tool to unscrew it.</li>\n<li>Take the new spray arm and attach it in the same position where you removed the old one. </li>\n<li>Secure it by tightening the locking mechanism or nut.</li>\n<li>Slide the lower rack back into the dishwasher.</li>\n<li>Reconnect the power to the dishwasher and turn on the water supply.</li>\n<li>Run a short test cycle to ensure that the new spray arm is working correctly. Check for any leaks or unusual noises.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How a Faulty Water Inlet Valve can Cause the AE Error</h2>\n<p>The water inlet valve controls the flow of water into the dishwasher during usage. It allows water to enter during different cycles such as for tasks such as filling the tub, and rinsing. If the water inlet valve is faulty or malfunctioning, it can lead to inadequate water supply, overflow, or leakage which triggers the AE error code.</p>\n<h3>How to Replace the Water Inlet Valve in an LG Dishwasher</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Disconnect the dishwasher from the power source and shut off the water supply to the dishwasher.</li>\n<li>Remove the kick plate at the bottom of the dishwasher to access the valve.</li>\n<li>Carefully disconnect the water supply line from the water inlet valve. It is recommended to have a container or towel nearby as water may spill out at this point.</li>\n<li>Carefully disconnect the electrical wires connected to the water inlet valve.

This issue can be caused by power supply problems, a malfunctioning door latch, or even an activated child lock. By following this easy-to-understand guide, you can diagnose and fix these issues in just a few steps.</p>\n<h2>What Does a Flashing Red Light Mean on a Bosch Dishwasher That Won't Start?</h2>\n<p>Your dishwasher can come with some helpful indicator lights. One of them is the InfoLight, a small red light projected onto the floor while the dishwasher is running. This lets you check the dishwasher's status when it is operating silently. Normally, this light should turn off when the cycle completes or when the dishwasher is not in use. However, if you notice the InfoLight flashing or staying on when the appliance is idle, it may indicate that the door isn't securely latched. Be sure to listen for a distinct clicking sound and feel for resistance when you close the door.</p>\n<p>The dishwasher may also have an LED light in the lower right corner of the control panel. This light turns red while the dishwasher is running, showing that it's in the middle of a cycle. After the cycle is complete, the light changes to green and stays on for two hours. However, if you notice it flashing, it could indicate a problem with the water supply. Be sure to check that the water supply to the dishwasher is turned on.</p>\n<h2>Why Is Your Bosch Dishwasher Not Starting?</h2>\n<p>When your dishwasher refuses to start, whether it is accompanied by indicator lights or not, these common causes could be at play:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Power Supply Issues:</b> Sometimes, the problem can be as simple as a tripped or overloaded circuit breaker. Make sure the dishwasher’s plug is securely connected and inspect your home’s electrical panel.</li>\n<li><b>Control Panel Malfunctions:</b> The issue may lie with the dishwasher's control panel, particularly the main control board. This board is responsible for sending signals to various components of the dishwasher to initiate the cycle. If these signals are incorrect or interrupted, the dishwasher won’t start.</li>\n<li><b>Door Latch Failure:</b> The door latch prevents the dishwasher from running if the door isn't properly locked. If the door latch is found to be faulty, it needs to be replaced.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How to Fix a Bosch Dishwasher That Is Not Starting</h2>\n<h3>Resetting a Bosch Dishwasher</h3>\n<p>Resetting your dishwasher can often resolve non-starting issues by clearing temporary glitches and restoring the machine's default settings. Here’s what you need to do:</p>\n<h4>Resetting Standard Models</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>On your dishwasher's control panel, locate the ‘Start’ button.</li>\n<li>Press and hold the ‘Start’ button for about 5 seconds. After releasing the button, wait for a moment. The dishwasher should reset itself.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Resetting Older Models</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>For older Bosch models, find the ‘Power’ button, which may be used instead of the ‘Start’ button.</li>\n<li>Press the ‘Power’ button to turn off the machine, then press it again to turn it back on.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Performing a Hard Reset</h4>\n<p>If the standard reset methods don’t work on your Bosch dishwasher, a hard reset might be necessary. This process involves cutting off and then restoring the power supply to the dishwasher, which can reset its internal systems.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Find the circuit breaker in your home that controls the power supply to your dishwasher.</li>\n<li>Switch off the circuit breaker for the dishwasher. By doing this, you're cutting off the power supply to the machine.</li>\n<li>Leave the circuit breaker off for about 5 minutes. This brief period is critical as it allows the dishwasher’s systems to fully reset.</li>\n<li>Flip the circuit breaker back on to restore power to the dishwasher.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>After completing these steps, try starting your dishwasher again. Often, a hard reset can fix minor issues. However, if your dishwasher still won't start, it could be a sign of a more complex problem.</p>\n<h3>Disabling the Child Lock on a Bosch Dishwasher</h3>\n<p>An engaged child lock on your Bosch dishwasher can be a sneaky culprit behind the appliance not starting. This safety feature, designed to prevent unintended use, can render the control panel inactive, leading to what appears to be a non-starting problem. To disable it, this is how it's done:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Look for the button on your dishwasher's control panel that's marked with a padlock or child symbol. The position of this button can vary depending on your Bosch model.</li>\n<li>Press and hold the child lock button for a few seconds, usually around 3 to 5 seconds. You should hear a beep or see a light indicator, signaling that the child lock has been deactivated.</li>\n<li>Once the child lock is off, try pressing other buttons on the control panel to ensure they are responsive.</li>\n<li>Now that the control panel is active again, select your desired wash cycle and start the dishwasher as usual.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Remember, the child lock feature is there for safety, so it's a good idea to activate it again if necessary once you've started your dishwasher.</p>\n<h3>Inspecting, Testing, and Replacing the Door Latch Assembly on a Bosch Dishwasher</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.partselect.com/Bosch-Dishwasher-Parts.htm\" target=\"_blank\">door latch</a> on your Bosch dishwasher does two important things: it keeps the door shut tight so no water leaks out, and electronically communicates with the dishwasher's control system. When you close the door and it clicks, the engaged latch tells the system that it's safe to start the wash cycle. If the latch is malfunctioning, this signal isn't sent, preventing the dishwasher from starting as a safety precaution. When troubleshooting the assembly, always refer to your Bosch dishwasher’s manual for specific instructions related to your model. To get started, do the following:</p>\n<h4>How to Inspect and Clean the Door Latch Assembly on a Bosch Dishwasher</h4>\n<p>The door latch is a small, typically metallic mechanism located at the top center of the dishwasher door. It features a handle or lever that clicks into place, securing the door when closed and engaging with the corresponding latch on the dishwasher frame.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Before anything else, ensure your safety by turning off the dishwasher at the circuit breaker.</li>\n<li>Examine the latch for any visible signs of damage or wear. Look for any bends, breaks, or rust that could hinder its function.</li>\n<li>Sometimes, food particles or other debris can obstruct the latch mechanism. Using a soft, damp cloth, gently clean around the latch mechanism. Be careful not to use too much water, as this could seep into the electrical components.</li>\n<li>If there’s hardened debris or grime, lightly scrub the area with a soft-bristled toothbrush to loosen and remove it.</li>\n<li>Once cleaned, dry the latch area thoroughly with a cloth to prevent any moisture buildup.</li>\n<li>Gently close the dishwasher door to see if the latch clicks into place properly. A proper latch should be smooth with a distinct click sound.</li>\n<li>Ensure that the latch aligns correctly with the catch on the dishwasher frame. Misalignment can prevent proper latching and, consequently, stop the dishwasher from starting.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>How to Test the Door Latch Assembly on a Bosch Dishwasher</h4>\n<p>Even if it seems to latch properly, it's essential to test its functionality to determine if it needs replacing:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>With the dishwasher disconnected from the power source, open the door and locate the latch assembly, typically at the top. You might need to remove the inner door panel to reach the latch’s electrical components.</li>\n<li>Set your multimeter to the continuity setting, indicated by a wave-like symbol or the word \"CONT.\"</li>\n<li>Touch the multimeter probes to the terminals of the latch assembly.

      "content_text": "What Does a Flashing Red Light Mean on a Bosch Dishwasher That Won't Start? Why Is Your Bosch Dishwasher Not Starting? How to Fix a Bosch Dishwasher That Is Not Starting Resetting a Bosch Dishwasher Disabling the Child Lock on a Bosch Dishwasher Inspecting, Testing, and Replacing the Door Latch Assembly on a Bosch Dishwasher Is your Bosch dishwasher not starting, and are you noticing a flashing red light? This issue can be caused by power supply problems, a malfunctioning door latch, or even an activated child lock. By following this easy-to-understand guide, you can diagnose and fix these issues in just a few steps. What Does a Flashing Red Light Mean on a Bosch Dishwasher That Won't Start? Your dishwasher can come with some helpful indicator lights. One of them is the InfoLight, a small red light projected onto the floor while the dishwasher is running. This lets you check the dishwasher's status when it is operating silently. Normally, this light should turn off when the cycle completes or when the dishwasher is not in use. However, if you notice the InfoLight flashing or staying on when the appliance is idle, it may indicate that the door isn't securely latched. Be sure to listen for a distinct clicking sound and feel for resistance when you close the door. The dishwasher may also have an LED light in the lower right corner of the control panel. This light turns red while the dishwasher is running, showing that it's in the middle of a cycle. After the cycle is complete, the light changes to green and stays on for two hours. However, if you notice it flashing, it could indicate a problem with the water supply. Be sure to check that the water supply to the dishwasher is turned on. Why Is Your Bosch Dishwasher Not Starting? When your dishwasher refuses to start, whether it is accompanied by indicator lights or not, these common causes could be at play: Power Supply Issues: Sometimes, the problem can be as simple as a tripped or overloaded circuit breaker. Make sure the dishwasher’s plug is securely connected and inspect your home’s electrical panel. Control Panel Malfunctions: The issue may lie with the dishwasher's control panel, particularly the main control board. This board is responsible for sending signals to various components of the dishwasher to initiate the cycle. If these signals are incorrect or interrupted, the dishwasher won’t start. Door Latch Failure: The door latch prevents the dishwasher from running if the door isn't properly locked. If the door latch is found to be faulty, it needs to be replaced. How to Fix a Bosch Dishwasher That Is Not Starting Resetting a Bosch Dishwasher Resetting your dishwasher can often resolve non-starting issues by clearing temporary glitches and restoring the machine's default settings. Here’s what you need to do: Resetting Standard Models On your dishwasher's control panel, locate the ‘Start’ button. Press and hold the ‘Start’ button for about 5 seconds. After releasing the button, wait for a moment. The dishwasher should reset itself. Resetting Older Models For older Bosch models, find the ‘Power’ button, which may be used instead of the ‘Start’ button. Press the ‘Power’ button to turn off the machine, then press it again to turn it back on. Performing a Hard Reset If the standard reset methods don’t work on your Bosch dishwasher, a hard reset might be necessary. This process involves cutting off and then restoring the power supply to the dishwasher, which can reset its internal systems. Find the circuit breaker in your home that controls the power supply to your dishwasher. Switch off the circuit breaker for the dishwasher. By doing this, you're cutting off the power supply to the machine. Leave the circuit breaker off for about 5 minutes. This brief period is critical as it allows the dishwasher’s systems to fully reset. Flip the circuit breaker back on to restore power to the dishwasher. After completing these steps, try starting your dishwasher again. Often, a hard reset can fix minor issues. However, if your dishwasher still won't start, it could be a sign of a more complex problem. Disabling the Child Lock on a Bosch Dishwasher An engaged child lock on your Bosch dishwasher can be a sneaky culprit behind the appliance not starting. This safety feature, designed to prevent unintended use, can render the control panel inactive, leading to what appears to be a non-starting problem. To disable it, this is how it's done: Look for the button on your dishwasher's control panel that's marked with a padlock or child symbol. The position of this button can vary depending on your Bosch model. Press and hold the child lock button for a few seconds, usually around 3 to 5 seconds. You should hear a beep or see a light indicator, signaling that the child lock has been deactivated. Once the child lock is off, try pressing other buttons on the control panel to ensure they are responsive. Now that the control panel is active again, select your desired wash cycle and start the dishwasher as usual. Remember, the child lock feature is there for safety, so it's a good idea to activate it again if necessary once you've started your dishwasher. Inspecting, Testing, and Replacing the Door Latch Assembly on a Bosch Dishwasher The door latch on your Bosch dishwasher does two important things: it keeps the door shut tight so no water leaks out, and electronically communicates with the dishwasher's control system. When you close the door and it clicks, the engaged latch tells the system that it's safe to start the wash cycle. If the latch is malfunctioning, this signal isn't sent, preventing the dishwasher from starting as a safety precaution. When troubleshooting the assembly, always refer to your Bosch dishwasher’s manual for specific instructions related to your model. To get started, do the following: How to Inspect and Clean the Door Latch Assembly on a Bosch Dishwasher The door latch is a small, typically metallic mechanism located at the top center of the dishwasher door. It features a handle or lever that clicks into place, securing the door when closed and engaging with the corresponding latch on the dishwasher frame. Before anything else, ensure your safety by turning off the dishwasher at the circuit breaker. Examine the latch for any visible signs of damage or wear. Look for any bends, breaks, or rust that could hinder its function. Sometimes, food particles or other debris can obstruct the latch mechanism. Using a soft, damp cloth, gently clean around the latch mechanism. Be careful not to use too much water, as this could seep into the electrical components. If there’s hardened debris or grime, lightly scrub the area with a soft-bristled toothbrush to loosen and remove it. Once cleaned, dry the latch area thoroughly with a cloth to prevent any moisture buildup. Gently close the dishwasher door to see if the latch clicks into place properly. A proper latch should be smooth with a distinct click sound. Ensure that the latch aligns correctly with the catch on the dishwasher frame. Misalignment can prevent proper latching and, consequently, stop the dishwasher from starting. How to Test the Door Latch Assembly on a Bosch Dishwasher Even if it seems to latch properly, it's essential to test its functionality to determine if it needs replacing: With the dishwasher disconnected from the power source, open the door and locate the latch assembly, typically at the top. You might need to remove the inner door panel to reach the latch’s electrical components. Set your multimeter to the continuity setting, indicated by a wave-like symbol or the word \"CONT.\" Touch the multimeter probes to the terminals of the latch assembly. A functioning latch should show continuity, often indicated by a beep or a reading near zero on the multimeter. No continuity (no beep or a non-zero reading) suggests a malfunction in the latch, implying it may require replacement. If the test fails, verify that all connections to the latch are secure and intact, as loose wiring can also cause issues. How to Replace the Door Latch Assembly on a Bosch Dishwasher If the door latch assembly on your Bosch dishwasher failed the continuity test, it's time to replace it. Here are the steps to replace it: Carefully remove the old door latch assembly. This might involve disconnecting a few wires, so it's a good idea to take a picture or note down wire placements for easy reassembly. Take the new door latch assembly and connect it to the door. Make sure to reconnect any wires exactly as they were on the old latch, referring to your photo or notes. Once connected, secure the new latch in place. Ensure it is properly aligned and screwed in tightly. Before reassembling everything, test the door to ensure the new latch clicks into place and holds the door securely. Put back any components or panels you removed during the process. Ensure everything is back in its place and securely fastened. Once everything is reassembled, reconnect the dishwasher to the power source and perform a test run to ensure the issue is resolved. Replacing the door latch assembly is a detailed process, so if you're not comfortable with appliance repair, consider consulting a professional. Using the correct replacement parts and following these steps carefully will help ensure your Bosch dishwasher runs smoothly again.",

If the start relay is malfunctioning you may hear unusual clicking sounds coming from the compressor area, or notice frequent cycling of the compressor without proper cooling. Inspect the start relay for damage and test it for continuity. If it is faulty, replace the start relay to restore your Frigidaire freezer. How to Test the Start Relay with a Multimeter Disconnect the freezer from the power outlet for your safety. Remove the access panel covering the compressor and start relay. Locate the start relay on the side of the compressor and take a picture of how the wires are routed. Disconnect the wire harness that connects the start relay to the compressor. Refer to your user manual or the wiring diagram to correctly identify which terminals to test. Turn on your multimeter and set it to the \"Ohms\" setting. Touch the multimeter probes to the appropriate terminals and check for continuity. If the start relay is defective, replace it using the instructions below. How to Replace the Start Relay to Fix a Frigidaire Freezer Remove the mounting hardware that is holding the start relay to the compressor. Discard the old relay and position the new one inside the appliance. Refer to your image from earlier and connect the wire harness to the new relay. Secure the new start relay in place using clips or screws. Reattach the access panel and secure it in place. Plug the freezer back into the power source. Allow the freezer some time to cool and confirm that the compressor is once again running smoothly. Condenser Fan Motor The condenser fan motor blows air over the condenser coils, helping to release the heat absorbed from the interior of the freezer. The condenser fan helps cool the refrigerant, and if it's not working, then the freezer may not freeze. Check for any obstructions that might be preventing the fan from turning. If the fan motor is faulty, use our model search feature to find the right replacement condenser fan motor . How to Replace the Condenser Fan Motor to Fix a Frigidaire Freezer Disconnect the freezer from the power source. Locate the condenser fan motor. It is typically situated near the compressor at the back of the freezer. Using a screwdriver or appropriate tool, remove the back panel covering the condenser fan motor. Identify the wires connected to the condenser fan motor. Take note of their positions or take a picture for reference. Carefully disconnect the wires from the motor. Locate and remove the mounting screws that secure the condenser fan motor to the freezer. If the fan blade is attached to the motor, carefully detach it. This is often done by removing a retaining nut or clip. Place the new condenser fan motor in the same position as the old one and reattach the fan blade if necessary. Use the mounting screws to secure the new motor in place. Reconnect the wires to the corresponding terminals on the new motor. Refer to your earlier notes or picture for guidance. Put the back panel back in its place and secure it with screws. Plug the freezer back into the power source. Turn on the freezer and check that the new condenser fan motor operates smoothly and that the freezer starts cooling properly. Evaporator Fan Motor The evaporator fan circulates air over the evaporator coils, which causes the refrigerant to absorb heat from the freezer. This process is essential for cooling the interior of the freezer and keeping all your food items at the right temperature. If it fails, the freezer may not cool or freeze properly. Use our model search feature to find the right replacement evaporator fan motor for your freezer. How to Replace the Evaporator Fan Motor to Fix a Frigidaire Freezer Disconnect the freezer from the power outlet. Open the freezer door and remove any food items or shelves. The evaporator fan motor is usually located in the freezer compartment, either behind the back panel or near the evaporator coils. . Unscrew the screws securing the back panel using a screwdriver. Locate the evaporator fan motor and take an image of how the wires are connected for installation later. Disconnect the wiring harness. Use needle-nose pliers if necessary. Remove any screws or clips securing the fan motor in place. Gently pull out the old evaporator fan motor from its housing. Place the new evaporator fan motor into the housing. Secure the motor with the screws or clips you removed earlier. Connect the wiring harness to the new evaporator fan motor using your image for reference. Put the back panel back in place and secure it with the screws. Reinstall any shelves that were removed. Plug the freezer back in. Allow the freezer some time to cool, and then check if the new evaporator fan motor is functioning properly. Control Board The control board communicates with various freezer components and sensors to control the functions of the freezer. If it malfunctions, it may lead to difficulties regulating the temperature or controlling the fans and motors, resulting in cooling problems. Check for visible signs of damage on the control board. If any are present, you will need to replace the control board . How to Replace the Control Board to Fix a Frigidaire Freezer Unplug the freezer from the power source. Refer to your user manual to locate the control board. It is typically found at the bottom of your appliance, towards either the front or rear end. Remove any covers/panels that conceal the control board. Before disconnecting any wires, take a picture of the current wiring setup. This will help you reconnect everything correctly later. Gently disconnect the wires from the control board. Unscrew the old control board from its mounting brackets, and discard it. Align the new control board with the mounting brackets. Secure the board in place using the screws you removed earlier. Refer to the picture you took earlier to reconnect the wires to the corresponding terminals on the new control board. Reattach any covers or panels you removed to access the control board and secure them back in place. Plug the freezer back into the power source. Faulty Compressor The compressor is the heart of the cooling system in your freezer. If the compressor is not functioning, the freezer won't cool. The compressor may fail due to electrical issues, a seized motor, or a failure in the internal components. If the compressor is making unusual noises, not running, or excessively hot, it will need professional repair or replacement. This is a critical component that involves a complex repair. It is recommended to call a qualified technician to address any compressor problems. As you've seen a Frigidaire freezer that's running but not freezing may be the result of various issues in the appliance.

Most refrigerator models with glass shelf panes will be made of tempered glass, so when removing it, whether to insert a new one or to clean it, allow it to return to room temperature before spraying it with water or cleaning spray. Otherwise, it will likely shatter and could potentially harm you and anyone around. You can replace a tempered glass shelf with an acrylic or strong plastic material, however, a material such as Corian is much more suitable as it's hypo-allergenic, easier to clean, and does not shatter.</p>\n<p>Be sure not to overload the glass itself, as tempered glass can normally only sustain around 35 lbs of force per square foot. To replace a glass pane shelf insert, simply lift it out of its position and pull it out. If your refrigerator's shelf frame has retaining clips, be sure to remove the frame as well, and undo the clips for the old glass pane before installing the new one. Then lay the new shelf where the old one was, and you're good to go!</p>\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;\">\n<div class=\"yt-video\" data-iframe-id=\"iframePlayer6gGDUmfrlvg\" data-yt-init=\"6gGDUmfrlvg\" tabindex=\"0\"><img alt=\"How to Easily Repair or Replace a Refrigerator Shelf\" class=\"b-lazy yt-video__thumb b-lazy\" data-src=\"https://img.youtube.com/vi/6gGDUmfrlvg/maxresdefault.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"/><svg class=\"i i--yt\"><use href=\"/images/part-info-sprite.svg#yt\"></use></svg></div>\n</div>\n<h3>Replacing a Glass Shelf with a Metal Frame</h3>\n<p>Replacing a glass refrigerator shelf with a metal frame likely means that the glass or the frame is broken or cracked, and not able to support any food items on top or in a drawer below.

Refrigerator compressors normally produce a low humming noise during various portions of the day, since they're essentially the refrigerator's motor. The evaporator also produces noise, although it's usually not as loud as the compressor is. However, if there is a louder-than-usual hum coming from your refrigerator, it may be a sign of frost buildup around the evaporator, or an aging and failing compressor. Then, if you are hearing extremely loud humming noises, there may be an issue with the condenser or evaporator fan that we will break down for you how to fix below, along with step-by-step video guides!</p>\n<h2>Refrigerator Noise Meanings</h2>\n<p>Occasional, low noises coming from your refrigerator are completely normal, and nothing to be concerned about – but there are definitely some noises that you will want to take more seriously than others. Here is a list of most refrigerator noises you'll hear, and what they mean:</p>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Quiet Hum/Buzz:</b> A low, quiet or subtle hum/buzz is a normal occurrence for most refrigerator models. This hum may be accompanied by a winding noise when the compressor turns on.</li>\n<li><b>Loud Hum/Buzz:</b> A louder hum or buzz may be an indication that the compressor is being overworked, meaning it could be dirty and needs cleaning, or if there is something warm left in the refrigerator and now the motor has to overcompensate to keep the fridge cool. It may also be the ice maker trying to produce ice, but if you don't have a water line connected to your fridge, ensure this is turned off.</li>\n<li><b>Very Loud Hum:</b> If your refrigerator is consistently producing a loud hum or buzz noise from its bottom and/or rear side, it means the compressor is likely failing and in need of service or replacement. A hum of this level will usually only come from an older refrigerator model, since most fridge models last between 15-20 years.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h2>How to Fix a Refrigerator Evaporator Fan to Solve Loud Humming Noises</h2>\n<p>If the evaporator fan in your refrigerator is blocked by ice, if its airway is blocked by food items, or if its motor is bad and needs replacing, your refrigerator will begin to hum or buzz loudly. Luckily, the evaporator can be fixed, and doing so is a repair that anyone can do!</p>\n<h3>Remove Food Items from Evaporator Fan</h3>\n<p>Depending on your refrigerator model, food items can block and clog the airway of the evaporator fan, preventing it from properly distributing cool air within the cabinet of the refrigerator and causing both the compressor and evaporator to work harder and hum or buzz distinctly loud. Simply moving food out of the way of the fan and clearing off any built-up frost should fix the humming and noise issue.</p>\n<h3>Thaw and Remove Ice from Evaporator Fan</h3>\n<p>Evaporator fans help maintain the internal temperature in your refrigerator. They pull warm air from the appliance through the evaporator coils to cool it. Depending on the model of refrigerator, the evaporator fan motor may also be used to circulate that cooled air. However, if the defrost system malfunctions or if any parts within it don't work properly, the fan mechanism will experience frost buildup and produce a humming or buzzing noise. If your refrigerator is experiencing defrost issues and significant frost buildup, we have a <a href=\"https://www.partselect.com/blog/frigidaire-refrigerator-h1-hi-error-code/\" target=\"_blank\">general how-to guide</a> on how to fix it!</p>\n<p>\n<ol>\n<li>Locate the evaporator fan.

There are a few reasons why your ice maker isn't working properly, some are easy fixes, and others require parts and tools! You can start by lowering the temperature of your freezer to below 0°F/-18°C, ensuring the shutoff switch/arm is not engaged, or emptying the ice maker bin. Then you can check the ejector fingers, water supply and tube, and infrared sensor to ensure those are not the cause. Finally, it's important to troubleshoot key parts like the water filter, door switch, ice dispenser paddles and water inlet valve if basic troubleshooting does not solve the issue. Whether it's a quick and easy fix, or a faulty part, we have the guide to walk you the steps required to get your ice maker up and running again!</p>\n<h2>Quick Ice Maker Fixes</h2>\n<p>Ice makers can be finicky, since they rely on consistently cold temperatures and key mechanical functions to turn over continuously day and night, making ice. Unfortunately, these functions can be interrupted by any slight fluctuation or disruption. However, the good news is these issue are often just as easy to fix as they are to occur. The following are the simplest common fixes to an ice maker that isn't functioning:</p>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Shutoff Arm/Switch is Not Engaged:</b> The shutoff arm/switch in many freezer compartments directly activates and deactivates the ice maker, and can accidentally be lodged into an, 'OFF' position. This switch is normally behind or around the ice bin, however your model may be different. Simply turn this arm/switch to the correct position to turn it on again.</li>\n<li><b>Ice Maker Bin is Frozen:</b> Referred to as, 'compacting', this is when a lack of movement, production or proper cleaning of the ice bin leads to it clumping together and freezing into a solid block. This results in the ice maker appearing to be broken, when in reality, the old ice just needs to be thrown out.</li>\n<li><b>Temperature of Freezer is too High:</b> When a freezer compartment's temperature is too warm or too cold, it can result in too small of ice or ice not being produced at all, or it can result in the entire ice bin freezing and being difficult to separate. Using a thermometer, you can test the internal temperature of the freezer compartment to ensure it's 0°F/-18°C or slightly colder. If the internal temperature is too high or too cold, use your fridge controls to adjust the temperature.</li>\n<li><b>Frozen Water Supply:</b> The water supply tube within an ice maker system is responsible for delivering water to the ice maker to freeze. This tube can freeze when there's a momentary lack of water pressure, a clogged water filter within the fridge, or a lapse within the temperature control of the freezer. However, if you pull out the ice bin, and using a hair dryer or similar tool, you can apply heat to the tube and de-thaw it, allowing the water to flow freely again. <b>Note:</b> Move the hair dryer and apply heat indirectly, since too much direct heat may cause the plastic to melt.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<p>Sometimes fixing your ice maker isn't as easy as the four methods described above. The following issues may require more time to fix, but are just as important to the functionality of your ice maker:</p>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Ejector Fingers:</b> In some fridge models a mechanism called, ejector 'fingers' – also known as bar, tines, or paddles – is used to eject the frozen ice created by the ice maker into the ice bin. This mechanism can become jammed and will require you to break-up the ice to become unstuck.</li>\n<li><b>Clogged or Kinked Water Tube:</b> A clogged or kinked water supply tube to your fridge will inevitably and naturally cause the ice maker to stop producing ice. If the temperature in your fridge is suitable and it suddenly stops producing ice, check the water supply tube for any clogs, kinks, or damage.</li>\n<li><b>Infrared Sensor Out of Position:</b> In some Samsung refrigerator models, infrared sensors are used to detect when more ice needs to be made, and when it needs to stop. If the sensor is dislodged, it will inaccurately detect ice and cause the ice maker to stop. Simply remove any built-up or lodged ice, and the sensor should restore functionality to the ice maker.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h2>Parts to Examine to Fix Your Ice Maker</h2>\n<p>If you've tried all of the above methods, and your ice maker is still not producing ice or working properly, you likely have the bigger task ahead of you – replacing a part. We understand that this is not good news, but we have the step-by-step guide you need to properly repair your fridge, and get cold ice now!</p>\n<h3>How to Replace a Clogged or After-Market Water Filter</h3>\n<p>Water filters are used for the dispensing of water and the creation of ice in the ice maker. If your filter is clogged or is an after-market variant, it will need to be replaced with an OEM filter immediately. Locating the filter in your refrigerator can depend on the model, however, key places to look for are the ceiling of the fridge's interior, as well as the bottom of the appliance or corners. You can find the OEM filter for your fridge model in our <a href=\"https://www.partselect.com/Water-Filter-Finder.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">PartSelect water filter finder!</a></p>\n<p>Water filters should be changed every 6–9 months for best water taste and appearance.

Trying to dispense some cold ice into your beverage of choice, but your ice maker isn't working? There are a few reasons why your ice maker isn't working properly, some are easy fixes, and others require parts and tools! You can start by lowering the temperature of your freezer to below 0°F/-18°C, ensuring the shutoff switch/arm is not engaged, or emptying the ice maker bin. Then you can check the ejector fingers, water supply and tube, and infrared sensor to ensure those are not the cause. Finally, it's important to troubleshoot key parts like the water filter, door switch, ice dispenser paddles and water inlet valve if basic troubleshooting does not solve the issue. Whether it's a quick and easy fix, or a faulty part, we have the guide to walk you the steps required to get your ice maker up and running again! Quick Ice Maker Fixes Ice makers can be finicky, since they rely on consistently cold temperatures and key mechanical functions to turn over continuously day and night, making ice. Unfortunately, these functions can be interrupted by any slight fluctuation or disruption. However, the good news is these issue are often just as easy to fix as they are to occur. The following are the simplest common fixes to an ice maker that isn't functioning: Shutoff Arm/Switch is Not Engaged: The shutoff arm/switch in many freezer compartments directly activates and deactivates the ice maker, and can accidentally be lodged into an, 'OFF' position. This switch is normally behind or around the ice bin, however your model may be different. Simply turn this arm/switch to the correct position to turn it on again. Ice Maker Bin is Frozen: Referred to as, 'compacting', this is when a lack of movement, production or proper cleaning of the ice bin leads to it clumping together and freezing into a solid block. This results in the ice maker appearing to be broken, when in reality, the old ice just needs to be thrown out. Temperature of Freezer is too High: When a freezer compartment's temperature is too warm or too cold, it can result in too small of ice or ice not being produced at all, or it can result in the entire ice bin freezing and being difficult to separate. Using a thermometer, you can test the internal temperature of the freezer compartment to ensure it's 0°F/-18°C or slightly colder. If the internal temperature is too high or too cold, use your fridge controls to adjust the temperature. Frozen Water Supply: The water supply tube within an ice maker system is responsible for delivering water to the ice maker to freeze. This tube can freeze when there's a momentary lack of water pressure, a clogged water filter within the fridge, or a lapse within the temperature control of the freezer. However, if you pull out the ice bin, and using a hair dryer or similar tool, you can apply heat to the tube and de-thaw it, allowing the water to flow freely again. Note: Move the hair dryer and apply heat indirectly, since too much direct heat may cause the plastic to melt. Sometimes fixing your ice maker isn't as easy as the four methods described above. The following issues may require more time to fix, but are just as important to the functionality of your ice maker: Ejector Fingers: In some fridge models a mechanism called, ejector 'fingers' – also known as bar, tines, or paddles – is used to eject the frozen ice created by the ice maker into the ice bin. This mechanism can become jammed and will require you to break-up the ice to become unstuck. Clogged or Kinked Water Tube: A clogged or kinked water supply tube to your fridge will inevitably and naturally cause the ice maker to stop producing ice. If the temperature in your fridge is suitable and it suddenly stops producing ice, check the water supply tube for any clogs, kinks, or damage. Infrared Sensor Out of Position: In some Samsung refrigerator models, infrared sensors are used to detect when more ice needs to be made, and when it needs to stop. If the sensor is dislodged, it will inaccurately detect ice and cause the ice maker to stop. Simply remove any built-up or lodged ice, and the sensor should restore functionality to the ice maker. Parts to Examine to Fix Your Ice Maker If you've tried all of the above methods, and your ice maker is still not producing ice or working properly, you likely have the bigger task ahead of you – replacing a part. We understand that this is not good news, but we have the step-by-step guide you need to properly repair your fridge, and get cold ice now! How to Replace a Clogged or After-Market Water Filter Water filters are used for the dispensing of water and the creation of ice in the ice maker. If your filter is clogged or is an after-market variant, it will need to be replaced with an OEM filter immediately. Locating the filter in your refrigerator can depend on the model, however, key places to look for are the ceiling of the fridge's interior, as well as the bottom of the appliance or corners. You can find the OEM filter for your fridge model in our PartSelect water filter finder! Water filters should be changed every 6–9 months for best water taste and appearance. Not changing your water filter will cause sediments and other normally filtered elements and minerals from entering your water and eventually, your body. The following video guide has more in-depth instructions for you to follow concerning your fridge's water filter. How to Replace a Broken Fridge Door Switch On either side of your refrigerator will be a door switch that either activates or deactivates any cooling or ice/water production when the door is opened. If the switch responsible for that ice and water production is bad or defective, which can be detected by the light properly turning on when the door is opened, it will cause your ice maker to stop working properly. Luckily, we have a wide-range of switches in our PartSelect refrigerator switch inventory , and a general guide to tell you how to replace it: Disconnect your refrigerator from its wall outlet to turn it off. Use two flat tools, such as a putty-knife and flat-head screwdriver, to pry the switch out from the interior wall of the freezer. Using a set of pliers, pull the switch out from its housing and disconnect any connected wire harnesses. Discard the switch, or test it with a multimeter for extra assurance. Connect the wire harness to the terminals of the new switch. Place the switch back into the door and push it firmly within the housing. Connect your refrigerator back to its wall outlet and test the door and ice maker after 10–15 minutes. Note : If your refrigerator has not made ice in a significant amount of time, give it up to 24 hours to produce ice. Below is a general video guide to instruct you on this repair. How to Replace a Refrigerator Water Inlet Valve Solenoid water inlet valves are used within refrigerators and appliances in general to activate to allow water to flow freely and contain filters to keep out any dirt or debris that could be in your water supply. If a water inlet valve is bad or becomes clogged and needs replacement, it will cause the water or ice dispenser in your refrigerator to have a weak level of pressure and not dispense or produce water and ice. However, you can find the OEM water inlet valve for your refrigerator model in our PartSelect inventory, and use the following general guide to remove and replace it: Turn off and disconnect your fridge from its water and power supply. Locate the inlet valve and remove any panels that may be securing it. Unthread any securing screws holding the valve in place, and pull the valve out. Remove any wire harnesses connected to the valve, and document their original position for future reinstallation. Remove each of the tubes connected to the valve, ensuring you have a towel handy in case water is still within any of the tubes. Once the old solenoid water inlet valve is removed and discarded, cut a quarter-inch off each tube before installing the new valve with the tubes and wire harnesses. With each tube and wire secured, install the new valve within the refrigerator, ensuring it's properly mounted and secure, and all screws are properly threaded. Reassemble any cover panels for the rear of the refrigerator, and connect the water line first, before the power line. Turn the refrigerator on and allow the fridge a few hours to calibrate before testing the water or ice maker, monitoring it for any leaks. The following is a general video guide to instruct you on this repair. How to Fix a Broken Fridge Ice Dispenser Actuator If your ice maker is producing ice but the ice is not dispensing, it is certainly an issue with its dispenser actuator, also known as a paddle.

Follow along to find out what these components are, how to\n locate them, and how to test them. Once your refrigerator temperatures have normalized, we’ll walk you through how to make temperature adjustments based on\n your preferences.</p>\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;\">\n<div class=\"yt-video\" data-iframe-id=\"iframePlayerda9oya03Kvo\" data-yt-init=\"da9oya03Kvo\" tabindex=\"0\"><img alt=\"Why is my Refrigerator Not Cooling?\" class=\"b-lazy yt-video__thumb b-lazy\" data-src=\"https://img.youtube.com/vi/da9oya03Kvo/maxresdefault.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"/><svg class=\"i i--yt\"><use href=\"/images/part-info-sprite.svg#yt\"></use></svg></div>\n</div>\n<h2>Is Your Refrigerator Getting Power?</h2>\n<p>Your first step in diagnosing your refrigerator is to determine whether you have power to the refrigerator. To check this, open the door and see if the internal lights come on. If so, we know we do have power to the appliance, and now we can move on to the next step. If no <a href=\"https://www.partselect.com/Refrigerator-Lights-and-Bulbs.htm\" target=\"_blank\">lights</a> come on this means they\n have either burnt out or the receptacle itself may have no power to it. You will want to plug in another appliance into the receptacle to verify whether you have power or not.</p>\n<h2>Are the Fans and Compressor Running?</h2>\n<h3>The Controls</h3>\n<p>Your next step will be to determine whether the fan in the refrigerator and the compressor are running. If you don’t hear any fans running, this may indicate that you have a problem with the controls. On a standard refrigerator with a dial-type control or a slide-type control, there is essentially an\n on/off switch that turns power on to the compressor and the fans. If neither of those is running, the problem is likely with the control. With models\n that use electronic controls, you’ll either need a good understanding of how those controls work or you’ll need to contact a technician to troubleshoot\n it further.</p>\n<img alt=\"Refrigerator Controls - Refrigerator Not Cooling\" class=\"b-lazy js_embed\" data-src=\"https://partselectcom-gtcdcddbene3cpes.z01.azurefd.net/assets/content/73098/refrigerator-not-cooling-controls.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"/>\n<h3>The Start Device or Relay Overload Device</h3>\n<p>If the fans on your refrigerator are running but not the compressor, it is likely a problem with the <a href=\"https://www.partselect.com/Refrigerator-Starters.htm\" target=\"_blank\">start device</a> for that compressor. Most compressors use either a relay overload device or a start device. To get the compressor running, those components can usually be tested with a multimeter to check\n for their proper function. Without the start device working properly, the compressor may not start and therefore you would not get any cooling. Most of\n these are easily checked with a multimeter. You will just pull the device completely off the compressor to test.</p>\n<img alt=\"Refrigerator Relay Start - Refrigerator Not Cooling\" class=\"b-lazy js_embed\" data-src=\"https://partselectcom-gtcdcddbene3cpes.z01.azurefd.net/assets/content/73098/refrigerator-not-cooling-relay-start.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"/>\n<h4>Relay Start Device Components:</h4>\n<h4>Capacitor</h4>\n<p>It may be called either a run capacitor or a start capacitor. The only thing that can be checked is whether it has shorted or not. Usually, the numbers\n on the multimeter rapidly change and then go to an overscale condition or an overload condition.</p>\n<h4>Overload</h4>\n<p>The purpose of the overload is to protect the compressor from starting and stopping mid-cycle with pressure built up. There should be continuity between\n the two sets of terminals on that device. One terminal that attaches to the compressor and the external terminal. They should show somewhere close to zero\n ohms.</p>\n<h4>Relay</h4>\n<p>The purpose of the relay portion of the device is to activate both the start and run windings on the compressor. Once the compressor comes up to speed\n the start winding will get dropped out so that it does not draw too much current. Typically, they will use some type of thermistor or varistor device\n internally. There will be some continuity between these two terminals. If there isn’t, you can assume that the device is defective. There are different\n types of relays, and the more modern ones with the electronic control boards internally can be very difficult to check with a multimeter without extensive knowledge of how that circuit works.</p>\n<img alt=\"Refrigerator Electronic Relay - Refrigerator Not Cooling\" class=\"b-lazy js_embed\" data-src=\"https://partselectcom-gtcdcddbene3cpes.z01.azurefd.net/assets/content/73098/refrigerator-not-cooling-electronic-relay.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"/>\n<h2>Inverter Drive Style Compressors</h2>\n<p>Lastly, you may find that your refrigerator has an inverter drive style compressor, which would have a box mounted to the side of the compressor.\n This performs the same function as the start device with the exception that it can also operate a variable speed compressor. Again, these are very difficult devices to troubleshoot without extensive knowledge of the circuits.</p>\n<h2>The Compressor</h2>\n<p>The last check would be on the <a href=\"https://www.partselect.com/Refrigerator-Compressors.htm\" target=\"_blank\">compressor</a> itself. You can test the internal windings on that compressor to verify that they’re in working order.\n You’ll find three male pins on the side of that compressor. Typically, the one at the top would be the common terminal and the other two would represent both the start and run windings. Measuring between the common terminal and each of the remaining two terminals would indicate that they all have continuity.\n The start winding will generally have a higher resistance than the run winding.  You will also want to look for any continuity between the three pins and\n ground on the case of the compressor. Make sure that there is no continuity between any of those terminals.

      "content_text": "Is Your Refrigerator Getting Power? Are the Fans and Compressor Running? The Controls The Start Device or Relay Overload Device Inverter Drive Style Compressors The Compressor How to Set the Temperature in Your Fridge If your refrigerator isn’t cooling, there are a few components that may be causing this symptom. Follow along to find out what these components are, how to locate them, and how to test them. Once your refrigerator temperatures have normalized, we’ll walk you through how to make temperature adjustments based on your preferences. Is Your Refrigerator Getting Power? Your first step in diagnosing your refrigerator is to determine whether you have power to the refrigerator. To check this, open the door and see if the internal lights come on. If so, we know we do have power to the appliance, and now we can move on to the next step. If no lights come on this means they have either burnt out or the receptacle itself may have no power to it. You will want to plug in another appliance into the receptacle to verify whether you have power or not. Are the Fans and Compressor Running? The Controls Your next step will be to determine whether the fan in the refrigerator and the compressor are running. If you don’t hear any fans running, this may indicate that you have a problem with the controls. On a standard refrigerator with a dial-type control or a slide-type control, there is essentially an on/off switch that turns power on to the compressor and the fans. If neither of those is running, the problem is likely with the control. With models that use electronic controls, you’ll either need a good understanding of how those controls work or you’ll need to contact a technician to troubleshoot it further. The Start Device or Relay Overload Device If the fans on your refrigerator are running but not the compressor, it is likely a problem with the start device for that compressor. Most compressors use either a relay overload device or a start device. To get the compressor running, those components can usually be tested with a multimeter to check for their proper function. Without the start device working properly, the compressor may not start and therefore you would not get any cooling. Most of these are easily checked with a multimeter. You will just pull the device completely off the compressor to test. Relay Start Device Components: Capacitor It may be called either a run capacitor or a start capacitor. The only thing that can be checked is whether it has shorted or not. Usually, the numbers on the multimeter rapidly change and then go to an overscale condition or an overload condition. Overload The purpose of the overload is to protect the compressor from starting and stopping mid-cycle with pressure built up. There should be continuity between the two sets of terminals on that device. One terminal that attaches to the compressor and the external terminal. They should show somewhere close to zero ohms. Relay The purpose of the relay portion of the device is to activate both the start and run windings on the compressor. Once the compressor comes up to speed the start winding will get dropped out so that it does not draw too much current. Typically, they will use some type of thermistor or varistor device internally. There will be some continuity between these two terminals. If there isn’t, you can assume that the device is defective. There are different types of relays, and the more modern ones with the electronic control boards internally can be very difficult to check with a multimeter without extensive knowledge of how that circuit works. Inverter Drive Style Compressors Lastly, you may find that your refrigerator has an inverter drive style compressor, which would have a box mounted to the side of the compressor. This performs the same function as the start device with the exception that it can also operate a variable speed compressor. Again, these are very difficult devices to troubleshoot without extensive knowledge of the circuits. The Compressor The last check would be on the compressor itself. You can test the internal windings on that compressor to verify that they’re in working order. You’ll find three male pins on the side of that compressor. Typically, the one at the top would be the common terminal and the other two would represent both the start and run windings. Measuring between the common terminal and each of the remaining two terminals would indicate that they all have continuity. The start winding will generally have a higher resistance than the run winding. You will also want to look for any continuity between the three pins and ground on the case of the compressor. Make sure that there is no continuity between any of those terminals. If so, the compressor is shorted and would need to be replaced, which would require a certified technician to do that repair. If both the evaporator and condenser fans are running and the compressor is running, and you are still not getting any cooling in your refrigerator, you can suspect that you have a seal system problem. That will require a qualified technician to perform a proper diagnosis.

When that happens, a thermostat that is located on the front end of that mold will detect the temperature. Once it detects\n\ta certain temperature, it will close the circuit. In the control section, this turns on a motor, and this will rotate the ejector arm, which will\n\trotate down on top of the ice cubes. The ejector arm will then just sit there and put pressure on the ice cubes. At the same time the motor\n\tis operating, on the bottom side of the icemaker, embedded into the mold itself, is an electric heater. The heater is turned on at the same time\n\tand will slowly warm up that mold. Once it reaches a certain temperature, this breaks the bond between the ice cube and the interior surface of\n\tthe mold. When that happens, the ejector arm can now push those ice cubes, rotate them back up the opposite side, lift out, slide over the edge,\n\tand drop them down into the ice container. At the same time that this is happening, as the ice cubes are fully ejected, the water valve that is\n\tlocated at the back of the refrigerator (single or two coil, or in the case of some models that use dispensers and filters, they may have as many\n\tas 3-4 solenoid coils), will turn on the coil that affects the icemaker, water will enter the cup at the rear of the ice maker or through the back\n\t, and it will run for a specific amount of time until it fills that mold to the proper level. The mold will sit there and wait for the process to\n\tstart all over again.</p>\n<h1>Why Isn’t my Icemaker Working?</h1>\n<p>Now that you have a basic idea of how an icemaker works, lets dive into some of the symptoms that may occur and troubleshoot what could go \n\twrong with your icemaker.</p>\n<h2>Symptom 1: No Ice Cubes are Being Produced</h2>\n<h3>Bail arm</h3>\n<p>Make sure the bail arm is not locked in the off position (this applies to a drop-down bail type or a slide-open type shut off lever). It should\n\tbe in the down position, which will turn on the icemaker control, allowing it to harvest ice cubes as they become frozen.</p>\n<img alt=\"Bail Arm - How to Troubleshoot an Icemaker\" class=\"b-lazy js_embed\" data-src=\"https://partselectcom-gtcdcddbene3cpes.z01.azurefd.net/assets/content/72956/bail-arm-down-position.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"/>\n<h3>Icemaker control</h3>\n<p>If the bail arm is working properly, the problem may be with the internal switch located on the control arm. It is operated by the bail arm,\n\twhich fits into a slotted opening on the control, and this controls the set of contacts located underneath. When the bail arm is in the \"on\" position, one set of contacts is closed, and when it is in the off position, a separate set of contacts are closed. If the contacts fail to make it into\n\tthe \"on\" position, the icemaker will not harvest any cubes. The components of the control are not serviceable, so if the issue is here, the entire\n\tcontrol will need to be replaced.</p>\n<img alt=\"Icemaker Control - How to Troubleshoot an Icemaker\" class=\"b-lazy js_embed\" data-src=\"https://partselectcom-gtcdcddbene3cpes.z01.azurefd.net/assets/content/72956/icemaker-control.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"/>\n<h2>Symptom 2: Ice Cubes are too Small</h2>\n<h3>Water line restriction</h3>\n<p>If the ice cubes are too small that would be an indication that not enough water is getting into the mold. There is no float that governs\n\tthe level of water in that mold, it is completely controlled by the amount of time that the water valve is turned on, which is controlled by\n\tthe icemaker control at the front. It is adjustable to a certain extent and typically somewhere between seven to ten seconds of fill time\n\tthrough the water valve, will give an adequate amount of time to fill the mold. Before making any adjustments, if it has been working fine\n\tall along, chances are it is not the control that is giving you the problem, it is likely a restriction in the water line going to the icemaker.</p>\n<img alt=\"Icemaker Water Line - How to Troubleshoot an Icemaker\" class=\"b-lazy js_embed\" data-src=\"https://partselectcom-gtcdcddbene3cpes.z01.azurefd.net/assets/content/72956/icemaker-water-line.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"/>\n<h2>Symptom 3: Ice Cubes are too Large</h2>\n<h3>Fill valve</h3>\n<p>The most common reason for ice cubes being too large is the <a href=\"https://www.partselect.com/refrigerator-valves.htm\" target=\"_blank\">fill valve</a> is staying on longer than power is being applied to it. This is a\n\tmechanical problem with the fill valve, making it so it does not shut off right away, allowing too much water in. This is usually caused by\n\tdirt getting inside of the valve, and the only way to correct this, is to replace it.</p>\n<img alt=\"Icemaker Fill Valve - How to Troubleshoot an Icemaker\" class=\"b-lazy js_embed\" data-src=\"https://partselectcom-gtcdcddbene3cpes.z01.azurefd.net/assets/content/72956/icemaker-fill-valve.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"/>\n<h2>Symptom 4: Ice Bin Overflows</h2>\n<h3>Bail Arm</h3>\n<p>The bail arm may be the incorrect one for your model. If you have recently replaced the bail arm, and are having this issue, double check\n\tthat you have the correct part for your specific model. The function of the bail arm, is that it should lift up during the ejection of the\n\tcubes and as it drops back down, if its not able to go all the way, or if it sits on top of the bin, this should shut the icemaker off without\n\tbeing in the locked position. If this does not happen because the bail arm is not the correct one, and doesn’t drop down far enough, you will\n\tget a bin that fills up with too much ice.</p>\n<h3>Icemaker Head</h3>\n<p>If there is a defect with the icemaker head, it will make it so the icemaker does not shut off.</p>\n<img alt=\"Icemaker Head - How to Troubleshoot an Icemaker\" class=\"b-lazy js_embed\" data-src=\"https://partselectcom-gtcdcddbene3cpes.z01.azurefd.net/assets/content/72956/icemaker-head.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"/>\n<h2>Symptom 5: No Cubes in the Mold</h2>\n<p>This symptom might also cause water to splash over the actual ice bin and freeze the cubes together.</p>\n<h3>Fill Tube/Fill Valve</h3>\n<p>The fill tube brings water into the fill cup and if this freezes up, water will splash everywhere, and none will get down into the mold\n\titself. This is usually caused by the <b>fill valve</b>.</p>\n<p>We hope that after reviewing our common symptoms and solutions you have been able to troubleshoot your own icemaker and have narrowed\n\tdown the parts you will need for your repair.

If this does not happen because the bail arm is not the correct one, and doesn’t drop down far enough, you will get a bin that fills up with too much ice. Icemaker Head If there is a defect with the icemaker head, it will make it so the icemaker does not shut off. Symptom 5: No Cubes in the Mold This symptom might also cause water to splash over the actual ice bin and freeze the cubes together. Fill Tube/Fill Valve The fill tube brings water into the fill cup and if this freezes up, water will splash everywhere, and none will get down into the mold itself. This is usually caused by the fill valve . We hope that after reviewing our common symptoms and solutions you have been able to troubleshoot your own icemaker and have narrowed down the parts you will need for your repair. If you have determined you need to replace one of the parts above, you can use your model number to search PartSelect.com for the OEM replacement part needed to get your icemaker back up and running again. Good luck with your repair, and checkout our YouTube channel for more helpful videos.",

In this article we’ll break down the differences between frost and ice buildup, and how the location of the buildup can indicate which part of your freezer is causing the issue. We’ll show you the steps to repair the faulty parts, along with some tips to prevent frost buildup from becoming a recurring problem in your freezer.</p>\n<p>To begin our repair, we’re going to start by completely defrosting the freezer. Please note that any of the repair guides and videos below are general information based on a fridge with freezer on top. The steps will vary based on your appliance model and location of the freezer (such as side-by-side or on the bottom). To find the instructions for your specific freezer, please search for the model number on our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/PartSelect\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube channel.</a></p>\n<h2>How to Remove Ice or Frost Buildup from Your Freezer</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>The first step is to unplug the appliance.</li>\n<li>Remove all food from the freezer and place it into a cooler or a spare freezer. You may want to remove food from the fridge as well. However, if you place frozen blocks inside and keep the fridge door shut the entire time, your fridge content may be fine during the repair.</li>\n<li>Note the location of the ice or frost buildup in your freezer, then leave the freezer door open to allow it to melt.</li>\n<li>As the ice softens, gently remove it with a plastic spatula or cloth. Don’t use sharp or metal tools, which can damage the inner surfaces of your freezer.</li>\n<li>Based on where the buildup was located, follow the recommended inspections below to determine the issue and begin your repair.</li>\n<li>Once your repair is complete, you can thoroughly clean and then plug the appliance back in. Wait until the freezer comes down to temperature before replacing your food items.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Frost on the Freezer Walls or Door</h2>\n<p>If you have frost throughout the freezer, such as along the walls and even on the door, this is due to warm, humid air entering the freezer. Simple things like opening the freezer door too frequently, placing hot food in the freezer, or leaving the door ajar can cause frost to form in these locations. Another cause may be a faulty door gasket. If the freezer door gasket is dirty or damaged, it can prevent the door from tightly sealing, which causes the room temperature air to leak into the freezer. This issue is easy to fix by either cleaning or <a href=\"https://www.partselect.com/Refrigerator-Seals-and-Gaskets.htm\" target=\"_blank\">replacing the gasket.</a></p>\n<h3>How to Fix a Freezer Door Gasket</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The first step is to visually inspect the door gasket and surrounding door area for crumbs, spills, or items that may prevent the door from sealing properly. When inspecting the gasket, check to see if it is torn, warped, or otherwise damaged.</li>\n<li>If the area is dirty, use a soft, damp cloth to clean up any spills or debris. If the gasket wasn’t damaged, your freezer door should now close properly, preventing any further frost buildup.</li>\n<li>If the freezer door gasket is cracked or split, it will need to be replaced. The method may vary depending on your freezer model, but it typically requires few or no tools to complete.</li>\n</ol>\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;\">\n<div class=\"yt-video\" data-iframe-id=\"iframePlayerzrL0bqWsbRc\" data-yt-init=\"zrL0bqWsbRc\" tabindex=\"0\"><img alt=\"How to Prevent Ice Buildup in a Freezer\" class=\"b-lazy yt-video__thumb b-lazy\" data-src=\"https://img.youtube.com/vi/zrL0bqWsbRc/maxresdefault.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"/><svg class=\"i i--yt\"><use href=\"/images/part-info-sprite.svg#yt\"></use></svg></div>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<h2>Frost (or Ice) on the Back Walls</h2>\n<p>The evaporator coils are located behind the back wall of the freezer, and this is typically the coldest spot where frost will form first. Modern fridges have a defrost mode that cycles on, which heats up the evaporator coils to remove any frost buildup. If a component of the defrost cycle is faulty, it can lead to build-up along the back of the freezer walls. The parts that may be causing this issue are the temperature sensor or thermostat, the heater, or the timer. To see if one of these components has failed, you can use a multimeter to test the part. While the exact location and steps to replace each of these components will vary by make and model, the videos below will provide an overview of the procedure.</p>\n<h3>How to Replace a Defrost Timer</h3>\n<p>The tools you will likely need for this repair may include a Phillips screwdriver, a flathead screwdriver, or a quarter-inch nut driver.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If your fridge is not already unplugged from defrosting the freezer, begin your repair by disconnecting the power from the appliance.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://www.partselect.com/Refrigerator-Timers.htm\" target=\"_blank\">defrost timer</a> will be found within the control assembly inside the refrigerator. To remove the control assembly, you may need to remove shelving from the fridge, along with the lightbulb for easier access. You will then need to remove any bolts or screws holding the control housing in place and remove it from the fridge.</li>\n<li>Place the control assembly on a work surface in order to remove the defrost timer from the housing. To remove the defrost timer, you will need to disconnect the wire harness, and you may need to remove bolts or screws if the timer is secured to the control housing. A flathead screwdriver can be used to remove the wire harness if it is not easy to pull off.</li>\n<li>The old defrost timer can be discarded, and the new one can be installed by reversing the above steps.</li>\n</ol>\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;\">\n<div class=\"yt-video\" data-iframe-id=\"iframePlayerTABAFjm27qI\" data-yt-init=\"TABAFjm27qI\" tabindex=\"0\"><img alt=\"How to Prevent Ice Buildup in a Freezer\" class=\"b-lazy yt-video__thumb b-lazy\" data-src=\"https://img.youtube.com/vi/TABAFjm27qI/maxresdefault.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"/><svg class=\"i i--yt\"><use href=\"/images/part-info-sprite.svg#yt\"></use></svg></div>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<h3>How to Replace a Defrost Heater</h3>\n<p>The tools you will likely need may include a Phillips screwdriver, putty knife, needle nose pliers, and a quarter-inch nut driver.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If your fridge is not already unplugged from defrosting the freezer, begin your repair by disconnecting the power to the appliance.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://www.partselect.com/Refrigerator-Elements-and-Burners.htm\" target=\"_blank\">defrost heater</a> is located behind the back wall of the freezer, so all food items and shelving will need to be removed in order to access the part.

How to Replace a Defrost Heater The tools you will likely need may include a Phillips screwdriver, putty knife, needle nose pliers, and a quarter-inch nut driver. If your fridge is not already unplugged from defrosting the freezer, begin your repair by disconnecting the power to the appliance. The defrost heater is located behind the back wall of the freezer, so all food items and shelving will need to be removed in order to access the part. Remove any screws or bolts that hold the back cover in place and carefully remove the panel from the freezer. Locate the wire harness for the defrost timer and disconnect it. Then remove any screws or bolts from brackets that may be used to hold the heater in place. The old defrost heater can be removed and discarded, and the new one can be installed by reversing the steps above. How to Replace the Defrost Thermostat Replacing a defrost thermostat requires a bit of electric work, so you will need a pair of wire cutters and strippers, and some electrical tape or heat shrink for this repair. If your fridge is not already unplugged from defrosting the freezer, begin your repair by disconnecting the power to the appliance. The defrost thermostat is located behind the back wall of the freezer, so all food items and shelving will need to be removed in order to access the part. Remove any screws or bolts that hold the back cover in place, along with any wire harnesses, and carefully remove the panel from the freezer. With the evaporator exposed, you should now be able to locate the defrost thermostat. Unclip the thermostat from the evaporator and then cut the wires that are connected to the thermostat. The old thermostat can now be discarded. On the new thermostat, you can cut back some of the wires and strip some of the wire insulation. Join the two sets of wires together by using a wire nut or splice. Electrical tape can then be used to keep the two wires together. With the new thermostat spliced together, it can be reinstalled back on the evaporator. Ice on the Bottom of the Freezer If there is solid ice (not frost) along the bottom of your freezer, there is likely a blockage in the drain hose, causing water to back-flow into the freezer and forming the layer of ice. The line will need to be flushed out, which can be done with compressed air. How to Fix a Blocked Drain Hose If your fridge is not already unplugged from defrosting the freezer, begin your repair by disconnecting power to the appliance. To clear a blocked drain line, we recommend doing so through the external drain outlet with compressed air. This won’t require much air pressure; a bicycle pump will do the trick. Whatever was obstructing the drain line will be blown into the freezer compartment and can be cleaned up from there. With the line now clear, the appliance can be plugged back in, and future ice melting from the defrost cycle should flow down the drain line instead of into the freezer. Practical Tips to Prevent Frost Buildup Now that we’ve solved the most common issues and parts that have caused frost build-up in your freezer and cleared it out, it’s time to make sure it doesn’t happen again. Fortunately, basic changes to some of your daily habits can help prevent future frost or ice buildup in your freezer. Since warm, humid air entering the freezer causes frost to form, following these tips can help prevent any issues: Limit how often you open the fridge and freezer door. Keep your unit organized so you can find what you need quickly. This is key to limiting how long the door is left open. Ensure the door is closed tightly after each use. Don’t place hot food in the freezer. Allow leftovers to cool down completely before storing. Promptly clean up any spills, which could prevent the door gaskets from sealing properly. A well-stocked freezer can help maintain a consistent temperature, but make sure it isn’t crammed to allow for proper airflow. By following these use-and-care tips, you can ensure that your freezer is running efficiently and frost-free. As with any repair, if it is outside of your comfort zone don’t hesitate to contact your preferred appliance repair technician.",
      "summary": "If you have ice or frost buildup in your freezer, there is typically either an issue with the airflow or with the defrost systems.  In this article we’ll break down the differences between frost and ice buildup, and how the location of the buildup can indicate which part of your freezer is causing the issue. We’ll show you the steps to repair the faulty parts, along with some tips to prevent frost buildup from becoming a recurring problem in your freezer.",

Fixing your refrigerator yourself, rather than hiring an expensive repair tech can save you time and money!</p>\n<p>One of the most common sounds to come from a refrigerator is a cracking or popping noise, which is usually the result of components and panels of the fridge contracting and expanding in response to a temperature change. This is particularly common in fridges that are “frost-free”. However, in addition to “regular” noises made by your refrigerator, a strange noise coming from the appliance could suggest that one or more parts are defective. Which is why you should always inspect the following parts prior to assuming they are routine noises:</p>\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;\">\n<div class=\"yt-video\" data-iframe-id=\"iframePlayernxHx8mhOnvY\" data-yt-init=\"nxHx8mhOnvY\" tabindex=\"0\"><img alt=\"Why is My Refrigerator So Noisy?\" class=\"b-lazy yt-video__thumb b-lazy\" data-src=\"https://img.youtube.com/vi/nxHx8mhOnvY/maxresdefault.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"/><svg class=\"i i--yt\"><use href=\"/images/part-info-sprite.svg#yt\"></use></svg></div>\n</div>\n<h2>Condenser Fan Motor Assembly</h2>\n<p>One of the most common causes of noise from your refrigerator is the condenser fan motor assembly. It is located at the back of the refrigerator, close to the floor, and typically is behind a cardboard or metal access panel. To inspect it, you want to look for a damaged fan blade with any part of the blade bent, distorted, or missing. You'll also want to check to make sure that it is tight on the motor shaft and that the motor shaft is not loose in the motor bushings. <a href=\"https://www.partselect.com/Refrigerator-Motors.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Shop Replacement Condenser Fan Motor Assemblies &gt;</a></p>\n<h2>Evaporator Fan Motor &amp; Blade</h2>\n<p>Another common cause for noise in a refrigerator is the evaporator fan motor. The evaporator fan motor is located next to the evaporator in the freezer section and there's usually a metal cover in front of it. To inspect it, first make sure that there's nothing that has gotten into the vent area that may be interfering with the blade. Then remove that cover to inspect the evaporator fan motor and blade assembly.

Unlike an evaporator fan or condenser fan motor noise, which typically has a consistent ticking sound or a scraping sound, a compressor noise is more likely to be a knocking sound that might occur when the compressor starts, and perhaps again when it shuts off. The compressor is typically located at the rear of the refrigerator, close to the bottom, and would be located behind an access panel. To inspect it, verify that the rubber mounts on the bottom are intact and not damaged.

      "content_text": "Condenser Fan Motor Assembly Evaporator Fan Motor & Blade Compressor Water Inlet Valve Wrap-up A refrigerator that is making more noise than it should is typically signaling that something is amiss. Fixing your refrigerator yourself, rather than hiring an expensive repair tech can save you time and money! One of the most common sounds to come from a refrigerator is a cracking or popping noise, which is usually the result of components and panels of the fridge contracting and expanding in response to a temperature change. This is particularly common in fridges that are “frost-free”. However, in addition to “regular” noises made by your refrigerator, a strange noise coming from the appliance could suggest that one or more parts are defective. Which is why you should always inspect the following parts prior to assuming they are routine noises: Condenser Fan Motor Assembly One of the most common causes of noise from your refrigerator is the condenser fan motor assembly. It is located at the back of the refrigerator, close to the floor, and typically is behind a cardboard or metal access panel. To inspect it, you want to look for a damaged fan blade with any part of the blade bent, distorted, or missing. You'll also want to check to make sure that it is tight on the motor shaft and that the motor shaft is not loose in the motor bushings. Shop Replacement Condenser Fan Motor Assemblies > Evaporator Fan Motor & Blade Another common cause for noise in a refrigerator is the evaporator fan motor. The evaporator fan motor is located next to the evaporator in the freezer section and there's usually a metal cover in front of it. To inspect it, first make sure that there's nothing that has gotten into the vent area that may be interfering with the blade. Then remove that cover to inspect the evaporator fan motor and blade assembly. Verify that that blade turns freely and is not damaged, that the motor is mounted firmly in the bracket, and that the shaft is nice and snug with no excess play in it. Shop Replacement Evaporator Fan Motor & Blades > Compressor A less common cause for noise in a refrigerator could be related to the compressor.

It will be located in the freezer, whether it's a side-by-side, or top-mount, or a bottom-mount refrigerator.</p>\n<p>Air from the freezer is then circulated into the fresh food compartment and back into the freezer in a continuous circulation. Typically, we would see about 80% of the air stay inside of the freezer and about 20% go into the fresh food compartment. With that ratio, we typically will get a temperature range of about 0 to +5 Fahrenheit in the freezer and about 36 to 38 degrees Fahrenheit in the fresh food section.</p>\n<h2>Thermostat Control</h2>\n<p>If your fresh food section is cooler than that, you may have a problem with the thermostat control, that's the device that turns the compressor on and off.</p>\n<p>That thermostat monitors the temperature of the air, either in the freezer or in the fresh food compartment, depending on the model.

Most modern refrigerators use an auto damper to control how much air comes into the fresh food section from the freezer.

Now, if you've determined that there does not appear to be any mechanical issues with your auto damper, the next thing we may suspect is the temp sensor that is associated with that. Most auto dampers will use some type of an electronic temp sensor to control the actual motor that drives the shutter or gate on that auto damper. The temp sensor is typically located somewhere close to that airflow and will often have some type of a connector on the end of it that it can easily be plugged in. Some manufacturers use a hardwired type of temp sensor and it's simply a matter of cutting those leads and splicing in a new one if you need to replace it.</p>\n<p>To test a temp sensor, we, first of all, need the manufacturer's specifications for that particular sensor and they will indicate the resistance of that sensor at a specific temperature.

Many modern refrigerators use electronics to control both the compressor, evaporator, and condenser fans in your refrigerator.

In models that feature Express 60 capabilities, it means there's too much water in the dishwasher itself and you'll need to make sure the drain pump and drain hose are working properly. In models without the Express 60 feature, it means a leak has been detected by the leak sensor and the inlet valve, float switch, or fill hose will need to be inspected. Our guide will explain how to troubleshot this, to get your Samsung dishwasher working!</p>\n<h2>Why Your Samsung Dishwasher Lights are Blinking</h2>\n<p>The control panel on your Samsung dishwasher features a number of buttons for each cycle selection, and above those there are indicator lights. During the cycle, the indicator lights are letting you know what cycle is running and what features are selected. If no cycle is currently running, and you notice any of those indicator lights flashing or staying on, your Samsung dishwasher is trying to communicate an issue. Since there are no electronic displays to show you an error code, the appliance uses these lights to notify you what the problem is. It can be a single light, like this articles discusses, or a combination of up to four lights.</p>\n<h2>Why is Your Samsung Dishwasher Not Draining?</h2>\n<p>Seeing a 'Heavy' light blinking on Samsung dishwasher models with an 'Express 60' mode, without any other indications, tells us that there's too much water inside of the dishwasher, and this normally indicates an issue with its draining system. This means there's a part not working as well as it could be, or broken enough to stop working properly. If your dishwasher has an 'Express60' button or 'Quick+' button, this would apply to your model.</p>\n<h3>How to Clean or Replace a Samsung Dishwasher Filter</h3>\n<p>The first and simplest part you can fix is the <a href=\"https://www.partselect.com/Dishwasher-Filters.htm\" target=\"_blank\">filter</a> in your Samsung dishwasher. The filter is designed to catch and trap any larger pieces of food debris from entering your dishwasher's drain and causing clogs or damage to the other more sensitive components. A clogged or damaged filter means water does not drain easily and food waste can more easily gain access to the drain system. This leads to further clogs and eventually too much water sitting in the dishwasher tub, which will raise the float switch and lead to a blinking 'Heavy' light. But we're here to explain exactly how to inspect your filter and either clean or replace it, so your dishwasher can properly drain.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open your dishwasher door and locate the filter, usually at the bottom of the tub's interior.</li>\n<li>Remove the lower dish rack, and if necessary, remove the lower spray arm to gain access to the filter.</li>\n<li>Remove the filter and, if necessary, clean it by soaking it in warm soap and water for 5 minutes, and then scrubbing it with a soft-bristle brush.</li>\n<li>Inspect the filter for any signs of damage, and if you notice any holes or other damage that would otherwise stop it from working properly, replace it with a new filter.</li>\n<li>Reinstall the dish rack and spray arm, then run a quick cycle on your dishwasher to monitor for the code or if water doesn't drain properly.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>How to Fix or Replace a Samsung Dishwasher Drain Hose</h3>\n<p>The next part you can troubleshoot if your dishwasher isn't draining properly, is its <a href=\"https://www.partselect.com/Dishwasher-Hoses-and-Tubes.htm\" target=\"_blank\">drain hose</a>. The drain hose, as its name implies, is a plastic hose attached to your dishwasher's drain pump that allows dirty and food-debris-filled water to exit the dishwasher and be disposed of. If this drain hose is clogged or cracked, it will cause water to either build up inside the dishwasher because it can't exit, or cause water to leak in and around your dishwasher, This leads to the float switch detecting too much water, and a flashing 'Heavy' light. To explain how to find your drain hose and see if it's in need of a replacement, check out the guide below!</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Locate the drain hose either behind the dishwasher or below it, or by inspecting underneath your sink.</li>\n<li>Run a short cycle on your dishwasher and monitor the drain hose for any water flow stoppages.</li>\n<li>If you notice the water stopping and/or not flowing consistently, disconnect your dishwasher from the wall outlet after the cycle is over.</li>\n<li>If your drain hose is clogged, use a screwdriver or wrench to remove any clamps and gain access to the hose's connection point, and use paper towel or a tube brush to dislodge and remove the clog.</li>\n<li>If your drain hose is also connected to a garbage disposal system, ensure it's turned off before you open it and inspect its interior for any clogs.</li>\n<li>If you discover your drain hose is not clogged but is instead cracked or broken, it will need to be replaced.</li>\n<li>Once your dishwasher's drain hose has been cleaned or replaced, run a short cycle to see if it drains properly.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>How to Clean or Replace a Samsung Dishwasher Drain Pump</h3>\n<p>The most time consuming part that you'll have to troubleshoot in your Samsung dishwasher if it's not draining properly, is its <a href=\"https://www.partselect.com/Dishwasher-Pumps.htm\" target=\"_blank\">drain pump</a>. The drain pump is what facilitates the draining of the dishwasher, and in some models can be the main motor for the filling and draining of all water. If the drain pump is clogged or bad, it will cause water not to drain and instead buildup inside the dishwasher tub, and lead to the float switch detecting too much water, and cause the 'Heavy' light to start blinking. Whether there's something lodged in the drain pump or if there's a broken seal, we've got the guide to explain to you precisely how to figure out what's going on in your dishwasher.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Disconnect your dishwasher from the wall outlet and turn off its water supply.</li>\n<li>Use a screwdriver or drill to unthread and remove the kickplate at the bottom of the dishwasher.</li>\n<li>Carefully unthread the fill hose from the inlet valve, and disconnect the electrical junction box and drain hose.</li>\n<li>Pull the dishwasher out, and flip it on its back by pulling and pushing its top backwards or to the side.</li>\n<li>Tip: Keep a towel close by for any water spilling that may occur.</li>\n<li>Unthread and remove any plastic panels covering the bottom of the dishwasher, as well as the leak detector sensor wire.</li>\n<li>Remove the wire harness from the drain pump's terminals, and rotate the drain pump counter clockwise while pulling it towards you to remove it.</li>\n<li>Inspect the drain pump for any clogs or damage, and remove any pieces of debris that could be causing the pump not to drain.</li>\n<li>If there's nothing stuck or lodged in the pump, ensure you've checked the drain hose and other drain system parts.</li>\n<li>Use a multimeter to test the pump for defects or failures. If it doesn't read nearly zero with both probes touching the terminals, or one terminal touching ground, the pump likely failed.</li>\n<li>Install the proper wires to the drain pump, and then install the drain pump into the dishwasher by rotating it clockwise and pushing on it.</li>\n<li>Replace the leak detector sensor, as well as the plastic cover panels if applicable, then flip the dishwasher back upright.</li>\n<li>Push the dishwasher back into place, and reinstall the fill hose, drain hose, and electrical junction box.</li>\n<li>Replace the kickplate and turn your dishwasher's breaker back on, as well as connecting the water supply.

When you turn your dishwasher on and start a cycle, the fill hose routes water from your home's water supply, to the inlet valve. Any issues with the inlet valve caused by electrical failure or a plugged screen will result in water underneath your dishwasher and a detection by the leak sensor, and a blinking 'Heavy' light. The easiest way to resolve this is by removing the inlet valve and checking for any issues with it, and either fixing or replacing it, which we'll explain how to do.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Turn off your water supply and disconnect your dishwasher from the wall outlet.</li>\n<li>Remove the kickplate at the bottom of your dishwasher and unthread the fill hose from the inlet valve, and disconnect its wires and drain hose under the sink.</li>\n<li>Pull your dishwasher out and flip it onto its back or side by pushing and pulling its top backwards or to the side, to gain access to the inlet valve.</li>\n<li>Tip: Make sure you keep a towel close by in case any water spills out.</li>\n<li>Remove any clamps on the inlet valve and fill hose, as well as the attached wire harness.</li>\n<li>Remove the inlet valve and inspect it for any cracks or damage, or if there are any clogs in its screens.</li>\n<li>If you notice signs of a leak from the inlet valve's area during any inspection, reassemble your dishwasher and run a quick cycle to observe any issues while it fills.</li>\n<li>To test the multimeter for full functionality, you can use a multimeter to check the valve for continuity.

If this drain hose is in any way clogged, kinked, or cracked, it can and will lead to leaking, which the leak sensor will detect and result in the 'Heavy' light blinking. But you can fix your drain hose by cleaning it or replacing it, depending on whether it's still in working condition; which we'll explain exactly how to find out for yourself!</p>\n<ol>\n<li>First off, you'll need to locate your fill hose underneath your sink and trace it to your dishwasher.</li>\n<li>Then shut off your water supply and the power to your dishwasher, by turning off its breaker.</li>\n<li>Take off the kickplate and disconnect the fill hose and its clamps (if applicable), drain hose, and the wires connected to the inlet valve.</li>\n<li>Inspect the fill hose for any cracks or clogs.

      "content_text": "Why Your Samsung Dishwasher Lights are Blinking Why is Your Samsung Dishwasher Not Draining? How to Clean or Replace a Samsung Dishwasher Filter How to Fix or Replace a Samsung Dishwasher Drain Hose How to Clean or Replace a Samsung Dishwasher Drain Pump Why is Your Samsung Dishwasher Leaking? Where is Your Samsung Dishwasher's Leak Sensor? How to Fix or Replace a Samsung Dishwasher Inlet Valve How to Clean or Replace a Samsung Dishwasher Fill Hose How to Replace a Samsung Dishwasher Float Switch If the 'Heavy' light on your Samsung dishwasher is blinking, it will mean one of two things depending on the model you have. In models that feature Express 60 capabilities, it means there's too much water in the dishwasher itself and you'll need to make sure the drain pump and drain hose are working properly. In models without the Express 60 feature, it means a leak has been detected by the leak sensor and the inlet valve, float switch, or fill hose will need to be inspected. Our guide will explain how to troubleshot this, to get your Samsung dishwasher working! Why Your Samsung Dishwasher Lights are Blinking The control panel on your Samsung dishwasher features a number of buttons for each cycle selection, and above those there are indicator lights. During the cycle, the indicator lights are letting you know what cycle is running and what features are selected. If no cycle is currently running, and you notice any of those indicator lights flashing or staying on, your Samsung dishwasher is trying to communicate an issue. Since there are no electronic displays to show you an error code, the appliance uses these lights to notify you what the problem is. It can be a single light, like this articles discusses, or a combination of up to four lights. Why is Your Samsung Dishwasher Not Draining? Seeing a 'Heavy' light blinking on Samsung dishwasher models with an 'Express 60' mode, without any other indications, tells us that there's too much water inside of the dishwasher, and this normally indicates an issue with its draining system. This means there's a part not working as well as it could be, or broken enough to stop working properly. If your dishwasher has an 'Express60' button or 'Quick+' button, this would apply to your model. How to Clean or Replace a Samsung Dishwasher Filter The first and simplest part you can fix is the filter in your Samsung dishwasher. The filter is designed to catch and trap any larger pieces of food debris from entering your dishwasher's drain and causing clogs or damage to the other more sensitive components. A clogged or damaged filter means water does not drain easily and food waste can more easily gain access to the drain system. This leads to further clogs and eventually too much water sitting in the dishwasher tub, which will raise the float switch and lead to a blinking 'Heavy' light. But we're here to explain exactly how to inspect your filter and either clean or replace it, so your dishwasher can properly drain. Open your dishwasher door and locate the filter, usually at the bottom of the tub's interior. Remove the lower dish rack, and if necessary, remove the lower spray arm to gain access to the filter. Remove the filter and, if necessary, clean it by soaking it in warm soap and water for 5 minutes, and then scrubbing it with a soft-bristle brush. Inspect the filter for any signs of damage, and if you notice any holes or other damage that would otherwise stop it from working properly, replace it with a new filter. Reinstall the dish rack and spray arm, then run a quick cycle on your dishwasher to monitor for the code or if water doesn't drain properly. How to Fix or Replace a Samsung Dishwasher Drain Hose The next part you can troubleshoot if your dishwasher isn't draining properly, is its drain hose . The drain hose, as its name implies, is a plastic hose attached to your dishwasher's drain pump that allows dirty and food-debris-filled water to exit the dishwasher and be disposed of. If this drain hose is clogged or cracked, it will cause water to either build up inside the dishwasher because it can't exit, or cause water to leak in and around your dishwasher, This leads to the float switch detecting too much water, and a flashing 'Heavy' light. To explain how to find your drain hose and see if it's in need of a replacement, check out the guide below! Locate the drain hose either behind the dishwasher or below it, or by inspecting underneath your sink. Run a short cycle on your dishwasher and monitor the drain hose for any water flow stoppages. If you notice the water stopping and/or not flowing consistently, disconnect your dishwasher from the wall outlet after the cycle is over. If your drain hose is clogged, use a screwdriver or wrench to remove any clamps and gain access to the hose's connection point, and use paper towel or a tube brush to dislodge and remove the clog. If your drain hose is also connected to a garbage disposal system, ensure it's turned off before you open it and inspect its interior for any clogs. If you discover your drain hose is not clogged but is instead cracked or broken, it will need to be replaced. Once your dishwasher's drain hose has been cleaned or replaced, run a short cycle to see if it drains properly. How to Clean or Replace a Samsung Dishwasher Drain Pump The most time consuming part that you'll have to troubleshoot in your Samsung dishwasher if it's not draining properly, is its drain pump . The drain pump is what facilitates the draining of the dishwasher, and in some models can be the main motor for the filling and draining of all water. If the drain pump is clogged or bad, it will cause water not to drain and instead buildup inside the dishwasher tub, and lead to the float switch detecting too much water, and cause the 'Heavy' light to start blinking. Whether there's something lodged in the drain pump or if there's a broken seal, we've got the guide to explain to you precisely how to figure out what's going on in your dishwasher. Disconnect your dishwasher from the wall outlet and turn off its water supply. Use a screwdriver or drill to unthread and remove the kickplate at the bottom of the dishwasher. Carefully unthread the fill hose from the inlet valve, and disconnect the electrical junction box and drain hose. Pull the dishwasher out, and flip it on its back by pulling and pushing its top backwards or to the side. Tip: Keep a towel close by for any water spilling that may occur. Unthread and remove any plastic panels covering the bottom of the dishwasher, as well as the leak detector sensor wire. Remove the wire harness from the drain pump's terminals, and rotate the drain pump counter clockwise while pulling it towards you to remove it. Inspect the drain pump for any clogs or damage, and remove any pieces of debris that could be causing the pump not to drain. If there's nothing stuck or lodged in the pump, ensure you've checked the drain hose and other drain system parts. Use a multimeter to test the pump for defects or failures. If it doesn't read nearly zero with both probes touching the terminals, or one terminal touching ground, the pump likely failed. Install the proper wires to the drain pump, and then install the drain pump into the dishwasher by rotating it clockwise and pushing on it. Replace the leak detector sensor, as well as the plastic cover panels if applicable, then flip the dishwasher back upright. Push the dishwasher back into place, and reinstall the fill hose, drain hose, and electrical junction box. Replace the kickplate and turn your dishwasher's breaker back on, as well as connecting the water supply. Then run a short cycle to monitor for any lights. Why is Your Samsung Dishwasher Leaking? The leak sensor in your Samsung dishwasher will blink the 'Heavy' light as an indication of water underneath it, if it's a model that doesn't have an 'Express 60' or 'Quick+' mode. This can happen for a couple of reasons, and we're going to break down the reasons and parts that would cause you to see the 'Heavy' light blinking on your Samsung dishwasher. Where is Your Samsung Dishwasher's Leak Sensor? Most Samsung dishwashers have a leak sensor at the bottom of the appliance that will communicate with the control board when there is moisture detected. Accessing this leak sensor to troubleshoot your dishwasher isn't difficult, but it does require some tools and time set aside to disassemble the dishwasher itself. Lucky for you, we'll explain exactly where to find it and what to look for. Disconnect the power to your dishwasher, and its water supply. Use a screwdriver to remove the kickplate at the bottom of your dishwasher, then carefully unthread the fill hose from the inlet valve and disconnect its wires and drain hose. Pull your dishwasher out and flip it onto its back or side, by pushing and pulling it backwards or to the side from its top. Tip: Use a towel to clean up any water that spills out. Use a screwdriver or wrench to unthread the plastic cover panel at the bottom of your dishwasher. Open the plastic cover and locate the leak sensor, which should be attached to it. Inspect around the leak sensor for any dried soap or moisture residue that could point to a specific part underneath your dishwasher that's leaking. You may notice dried soap or moisture near the drain hose or drain pump, and you can read the guides above for how to properly troubleshoot those parts. How to Fix or Replace a Samsung Dishwasher Inlet Valve If any sort of leak is occurring underneath your Samsung dishwasher, it will very likely have something to do with its inlet valve . When you turn your dishwasher on and start a cycle, the fill hose routes water from your home's water supply, to the inlet valve. Any issues with the inlet valve caused by electrical failure or a plugged screen will result in water underneath your dishwasher and a detection by the leak sensor, and a blinking 'Heavy' light. The easiest way to resolve this is by removing the inlet valve and checking for any issues with it, and either fixing or replacing it, which we'll explain how to do. Turn off your water supply and disconnect your dishwasher from the wall outlet. Remove the kickplate at the bottom of your dishwasher and unthread the fill hose from the inlet valve, and disconnect its wires and drain hose under the sink. Pull your dishwasher out and flip it onto its back or side by pushing and pulling its top backwards or to the side, to gain access to the inlet valve. Tip: Make sure you keep a towel close by in case any water spills out. Remove any clamps on the inlet valve and fill hose, as well as the attached wire harness. Remove the inlet valve and inspect it for any cracks or damage, or if there are any clogs in its screens. If you notice signs of a leak from the inlet valve's area during any inspection, reassemble your dishwasher and run a quick cycle to observe any issues while it fills. To test the multimeter for full functionality, you can use a multimeter to check the valve for continuity. Set your multimeter to x1 and touch the probes to each of the valve's terminals (this also applies if the solenoid has four terminals). If the inlet valve reads infinity, the solenoid is faulty and the valve will need to be replaced. Install the existing or new inlet valve. Flip your dishwasher back upright and into place, and reinstall the wires and its fill and drain hose. Connect your dishwasher's power and water supply, and then run a quick cycle to monitor for any leaks or error lights. How to Clean or Replace a Samsung Dishwasher Fill Hose Similar to its drain hose, a dishwasher fill hose allows water to flow freely from the water supply to the inlet valve and be used to clean your dishes. If this drain hose is in any way clogged, kinked, or cracked, it can and will lead to leaking, which the leak sensor will detect and result in the 'Heavy' light blinking. But you can fix your drain hose by cleaning it or replacing it, depending on whether it's still in working condition; which we'll explain exactly how to find out for yourself! First off, you'll need to locate your fill hose underneath your sink and trace it to your dishwasher. Then shut off your water supply and the power to your dishwasher, by turning off its breaker. Take off the kickplate and disconnect the fill hose and its clamps (if applicable), drain hose, and the wires connected to the inlet valve. Inspect the fill hose for any cracks or clogs. Use a paper towel or tube brush to clean the inside of the hose if any clogs are present. If it's damaged or cracked in any way, it will need to be replaced immediately. Install the fill hose to the inlet valve and replace any clamps that were removed, as well as the wires and drain hose. Turn your water supply on and connect the dishwasher to power. Run a quick cycle in your dishwasher and monitor for any leaks or leak indicators. How to Replace a Samsung Dishwasher Float Switch A part that could be responsible for the leaks in your dishwasher is the float switch, which is always handy to check to ensure it's working properly. The float switch , also known as the flood switch, detects how much water is in your dishwasher and activates the pump if too much water is present. The issue being that if the float switch is bad, water will continue to fill into the dishwasher and eventually leak out of your dishwasher, and cause the leak sensor to detect it, which is where you see the 'Heavy' light blinking. So if you're curious whether this part is working properly, read on! Disconnect power to your dishwasher. Locate the float switch in your dishwasher at the bottom of the appliance, underneath the spray arm, which will appear as a small round component. To gain access to the float switch, you will need to remove the spray arm, dish racks, and unthread and remove certain panels within your dishwasher. Once you've gained access to the switch, carefully remove it and disconnect any wires connected to it. Use a multimeter to test the switch for continuity, and replace it if it's bad or defective. With the new or existing switch, install it into place in your dishwasher and secure whichever panels were originally removed, as well as the spray arm and dish racks. Run a few cycles in your dishwasher and monitor for leak detections or other issues.

When this occurs, your dishwasher will shut off the water intake to prevent water damage to your home. With this guide, you'll learn how to systematically inspect these parts to clear the code.</p>\n<h2>What Does the E15 Error Code Mean on a Bosch Dishwasher?</h2>\n<p>Flashing ‘E15’ is your Bosch dishwasher’s way of telling you that it has detected water accumulating in the base pan underneath the appliance. This occurs during a leakage, as water travels down the dishwasher's double-wall hose and collects in the base pan. As water pools in the pan, it activates a safety switch, which then stops the water intake and displays the error code. This safety feature is called “AquaStop”, and it is designed to prevent water damage to your home.</p>\n<h2>What Causes the E15 Error Code on a Bosch Dishwasher?</h2>\n<p>Understanding the potential causes behind the E15 error is crucial for effective troubleshooting. Several factors can trigger this code, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Leaky Seals or Gaskets:</b> The door seal or gaskets seal the dishwasher tightly during operation. Over time, the door seal or gaskets around the dishwasher can wear out or become damaged, allowing water to escape into the base pan.</li>\n<li><b>Cracks or Damage to the Dishwasher Tub:</b> Any physical damage to the inside of the dishwasher can lead to water leaking into the base pan.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How to Fix the E15 Error Code on a Bosch Dishwasher</h2>\n<p>Clearing the E15 error involves two main steps: getting rid of any water in the dishwasher's base and then fixing the underlying cause of the leak.</p>\n<h3>How to Hard Reset a Bosch Dishwasher to Fix the E15 Error Code</h3>\n<p>The error code can sometimes be caused by a control board glitch that could be cleared with a hard reset. To do this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Disconnect your dishwasher from its power source for about five minutes. This gives the dishwasher’s internal system a chance to reset itself.</li>\n<li>After waiting, turn the power back on.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If the error persists, it means there’s water in the base of the dishwasher that will need to be removed.</p>\n<h3>How to Remove Water from a Bosch Dishwasher to Fix the E15 Error Code</h3>\n<p>The base pan catches any water that may leak or spill when your dishwasher is running. It is found at the bottom of the machine, underneath the main washing compartment. To remove water from it, you will need to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Begin by making sure the dishwasher is unplugged or disconnected from its power source, and that its water supply is shut off.</li>\n<li>Have some towels or a container ready to catch any water that comes out from your dishwasher during this process.</li>\n<li>Gently tilt the dishwasher backward at a 45-degree angle to drain out the unwanted water in the base pan.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Even though tilting the dishwasher might fix the error temporarily, you're likely to see it again if you don't find and fix the leak causing the water buildup. Be sure to inspect the dishwasher’s door seal, water inlet valve, and all hoses for any signs of leaks, as these are common sources of issues that could lead to water accumulation in the base pan again.</p>\n<h3>How to Inspect a Bosch Dishwasher Door Seal to Fix the E15 Error Code</h3>\n<p>The door seal runs along the perimeter of the dishwasher door, creating a watertight barrier to prevent water from leaking out during wash cycles. Open the door fully to expose the entire seal and carefully examine it. Look for any signs of wear or areas where the seal might have come loose. If the seal is compromised, it must be replaced. <a href=\"https://www.partselect.com/Bosch-Dishwasher-Parts.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Replacement seals</a> can be installed with a bit of patience. To remove a damaged door seal:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Start at one end and gently pull it away from its groove. Most seals are press-fitted and do not require tools for removal.</li>\n<li>Then, clean the groove or channel where the seal sits.</li>\n<li>Remove any residue, food particles, or buildup to ensure the area is clean and smooth for the new seal.</li>\n<li>Take the new seal and begin to press it into place, starting at one corner and working your way around the door. Make sure the seal is evenly seated in the groove without any twists or folds.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>How to Inspect a Bosch Dishwasher Water Inlet Valve to Fix the E15 Error Code</h3>\n<p>The inlet valve opens at the beginning of each wash cycle to allow water to enter your dishwasher. It then closes to stop the flow once the correct level is reached. If this valve does not close completely, it can lead to excessive water entering the dishwasher, potentially resulting in leaks. To inspect the valve:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Find the inlet valve at the bottom front section of your dishwasher, behind the lower kickplate or access panel. You’ll need to remove this panel with a screwdriver to reach the valve.</li>\n<li>Visually examine it for any signs of wear or corrosion. This might include water marks, rust, or mineral deposits on or around the valve.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you find yourself needing to install a <a href=\"https://www.partselect.com/Bosch-Dishwasher-Parts.htm\" target=\"_blank\">new water valve</a>, follow these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Disconnect the electrical connectors from the existing inlet valve. Take note of how the wires were attached for reassembly.</li>\n<li>Use pliers or an adjustable wrench to loosen and disconnect the water supply line from the valve. Be prepared for some water to spill out.</li>\n<li>Unscrew any mounting screws holding the existing valve in place. Once freed, remove it.</li>\n<li>Position the new valve and secure it with screws.</li>\n<li>Reattach the water supply line and electrical connectors, ensuring a snug and secure fit.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>How to Inspect a Bosch Dishwasher Hose to Fix the E15 Error Code\n</h3>\n<p>The supply line hose brings fresh water into the dishwasher, while the drain hose carries wastewater away. Generally, you can find the supply hose attached to the water inlet valve at the bottom of the dishwasher, often accessible from the front lower panel. The drain hose usually runs from the dishwasher pump to the sink drain or garbage disposal.</p>\n<p>Inspect the hoses for any signs of wear. Connections should be tight and secure to prevent water from escaping. If you discover damage on them, purchasing <a href=\"https://www.partselect.com/Bosch-Dishwasher-Hoses-and-Tubes.htm\" target=\"_blank\">replacement hoses</a> is necessary. To replace a hose:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Loosen the clamps or fittings securing the hose to the dishwasher and to the water supply or drain.</li>\n<li>Route the new hose similarly to the old one, connecting it to the appropriate points on the dishwasher and the water supply or drainage system.</li>\n<li>Secure all connections with clamps or fittings.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>How to Reset the Bosch Dishwasher Safety Switch to Fix the E15 Error Code</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.partselect.com/Bosch-Dishwasher-Switches.htm\" target=\"_blank\">safety switch</a> monitors the water levels in the dishwasher's base. It works in conjunction with a polystyrene or Styrofoam disk that floats upwards as water accumulates. If the water level becomes too high, the floating disk activates the safety switch, which signals the dishwasher to display the error. The safety switch is located at the bottom of the dishwasher. To access the switch:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Remove the outer door panel and the dishwasher’s kickplate. The type of screwdriver needed (T20 or T15 Torx, or a Phillips-head) for this step depends on your dishwasher model.</li>\n<li>Once removed, the safety switch should be visible in the center of the machine. Twist and pull the safety switch to release it from its position.</li>\n<li>Carefully lift out the disk. This is the perfect opportunity to inspect it for damage and to clean the area beneath it.</li>\n<li>After cleaning and drying the components and the basin, reposition the disk and securely reattach the safety switch.</li>\n<li>Ensure there are no obstructions and that the disk can move freely.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keeping up with routine maintenance can help avoid E15 error codes in the future. If these solutions don't resolve the issue, it might be time to call in an expert or reach out to Bosch’s customer support for advice.

How to Fix the E15 Error Code on a Bosch Dishwasher How to Hard Reset a Bosch Dishwasher to Fix the E15 Error Code How to Remove Water from a Bosch Dishwasher to Fix the E15 Error Code How to Inspect a Bosch Dishwasher Door Seal to Fix the E15 Error Code How to Inspect a Bosch Dishwasher Water Inlet Valve to Fix the E15 Error Code How to Reset the Bosch Dishwasher Safety Switch to Fix the E15 Error Code The E15 error code on your Bosch dishwasher indicates water pooling in the base pan underneath the machine, usually caused by leaks from a loose door seal, a failing water inlet valve, or worn-out hoses. When this occurs, your dishwasher will shut off the water intake to prevent water damage to your home. With this guide, you'll learn how to systematically inspect these parts to clear the code. What Does the E15 Error Code Mean on a Bosch Dishwasher? Flashing ‘E15’ is your Bosch dishwasher’s way of telling you that it has detected water accumulating in the base pan underneath the appliance. This occurs during a leakage, as water travels down the dishwasher's double-wall hose and collects in the base pan. As water pools in the pan, it activates a safety switch, which then stops the water intake and displays the error code. This safety feature is called “AquaStop”, and it is designed to prevent water damage to your home. What Causes the E15 Error Code on a Bosch Dishwasher? Understanding the potential causes behind the E15 error is crucial for effective troubleshooting. Several factors can trigger this code, including: Leaky Seals or Gaskets: The door seal or gaskets seal the dishwasher tightly during operation. Over time, the door seal or gaskets around the dishwasher can wear out or become damaged, allowing water to escape into the base pan. Cracks or Damage to the Dishwasher Tub: Any physical damage to the inside of the dishwasher can lead to water leaking into the base pan. How to Fix the E15 Error Code on a Bosch Dishwasher Clearing the E15 error involves two main steps: getting rid of any water in the dishwasher's base and then fixing the underlying cause of the leak. How to Hard Reset a Bosch Dishwasher to Fix the E15 Error Code The error code can sometimes be caused by a control board glitch that could be cleared with a hard reset. To do this: Disconnect your dishwasher from its power source for about five minutes. This gives the dishwasher’s internal system a chance to reset itself. After waiting, turn the power back on. If the error persists, it means there’s water in the base of the dishwasher that will need to be removed. How to Remove Water from a Bosch Dishwasher to Fix the E15 Error Code The base pan catches any water that may leak or spill when your dishwasher is running. It is found at the bottom of the machine, underneath the main washing compartment. To remove water from it, you will need to: Begin by making sure the dishwasher is unplugged or disconnected from its power source, and that its water supply is shut off. Have some towels or a container ready to catch any water that comes out from your dishwasher during this process. Gently tilt the dishwasher backward at a 45-degree angle to drain out the unwanted water in the base pan. Even though tilting the dishwasher might fix the error temporarily, you're likely to see it again if you don't find and fix the leak causing the water buildup. Be sure to inspect the dishwasher’s door seal, water inlet valve, and all hoses for any signs of leaks, as these are common sources of issues that could lead to water accumulation in the base pan again. How to Inspect a Bosch Dishwasher Door Seal to Fix the E15 Error Code The door seal runs along the perimeter of the dishwasher door, creating a watertight barrier to prevent water from leaking out during wash cycles. Open the door fully to expose the entire seal and carefully examine it. Look for any signs of wear or areas where the seal might have come loose. If the seal is compromised, it must be replaced. Replacement seals can be installed with a bit of patience. To remove a damaged door seal: Start at one end and gently pull it away from its groove. Most seals are press-fitted and do not require tools for removal. Then, clean the groove or channel where the seal sits. Remove any residue, food particles, or buildup to ensure the area is clean and smooth for the new seal. Take the new seal and begin to press it into place, starting at one corner and working your way around the door. Make sure the seal is evenly seated in the groove without any twists or folds. How to Inspect a Bosch Dishwasher Water Inlet Valve to Fix the E15 Error Code The inlet valve opens at the beginning of each wash cycle to allow water to enter your dishwasher. It then closes to stop the flow once the correct level is reached. If this valve does not close completely, it can lead to excessive water entering the dishwasher, potentially resulting in leaks. To inspect the valve: Find the inlet valve at the bottom front section of your dishwasher, behind the lower kickplate or access panel. You’ll need to remove this panel with a screwdriver to reach the valve. Visually examine it for any signs of wear or corrosion. This might include water marks, rust, or mineral deposits on or around the valve. If you find yourself needing to install a new water valve , follow these steps: Disconnect the electrical connectors from the existing inlet valve. Take note of how the wires were attached for reassembly. Use pliers or an adjustable wrench to loosen and disconnect the water supply line from the valve. Be prepared for some water to spill out. Unscrew any mounting screws holding the existing valve in place. Once freed, remove it. Position the new valve and secure it with screws. Reattach the water supply line and electrical connectors, ensuring a snug and secure fit. How to Inspect a Bosch Dishwasher Hose to Fix the E15 Error Code The supply line hose brings fresh water into the dishwasher, while the drain hose carries wastewater away. Generally, you can find the supply hose attached to the water inlet valve at the bottom of the dishwasher, often accessible from the front lower panel. The drain hose usually runs from the dishwasher pump to the sink drain or garbage disposal. Inspect the hoses for any signs of wear. Connections should be tight and secure to prevent water from escaping. If you discover damage on them, purchasing replacement hoses is necessary. To replace a hose: Loosen the clamps or fittings securing the hose to the dishwasher and to the water supply or drain. Route the new hose similarly to the old one, connecting it to the appropriate points on the dishwasher and the water supply or drainage system. Secure all connections with clamps or fittings. How to Reset the Bosch Dishwasher Safety Switch to Fix the E15 Error Code The safety switch monitors the water levels in the dishwasher's base. It works in conjunction with a polystyrene or Styrofoam disk that floats upwards as water accumulates. If the water level becomes too high, the floating disk activates the safety switch, which signals the dishwasher to display the error. The safety switch is located at the bottom of the dishwasher. To access the switch: Remove the outer door panel and the dishwasher’s kickplate. The type of screwdriver needed (T20 or T15 Torx, or a Phillips-head) for this step depends on your dishwasher model. Once removed, the safety switch should be visible in the center of the machine. Twist and pull the safety switch to release it from its position. Carefully lift out the disk. This is the perfect opportunity to inspect it for damage and to clean the area beneath it. After cleaning and drying the components and the basin, reposition the disk and securely reattach the safety switch. Ensure there are no obstructions and that the disk can move freely. Keeping up with routine maintenance can help avoid E15 error codes in the future. If these solutions don't resolve the issue, it might be time to call in an expert or reach out to Bosch’s customer support for advice.
