In this article we’ll break down the differences between frost and ice buildup, and how the location of the buildup can indicate which part of your freezer is causing the issue. We’ll show you the steps to repair the faulty parts, along with some tips to prevent frost buildup from becoming a recurring problem in your freezer. To begin our repair, we’re going to start by completely defrosting the freezer. Please note that any of the repair guides and videos below are general information based on a fridge with freezer on top. The steps will vary based on your appliance model and location of the freezer (such as side-by-side or on the bottom). To find the instructions for your specific freezer, please search for the model number on our YouTube channel. How to Remove Ice or Frost Buildup from Your Freezer The first step is to unplug the appliance. Remove all food from the freezer and place it into a cooler or a spare freezer. You may want to remove food from the fridge as well. However, if you place frozen blocks inside and keep the fridge door shut the entire time, your fridge content may be fine during the repair. Note the location of the ice or frost buildup in your freezer, then leave the freezer door open to allow it to melt. As the ice softens, gently remove it with a plastic spatula or cloth. Don’t use sharp or metal tools, which can damage the inner surfaces of your freezer. Based on where the buildup was located, follow the recommended inspections below to determine the issue and begin your repair.",

Wait until the freezer comes down to temperature before replacing your food items. Frost on the Freezer Walls or Door If you have frost throughout the freezer, such as along the walls and even on the door, this is due to warm, humid air entering the freezer. Simple things like opening the freezer door too frequently, placing hot food in the freezer, or leaving the door ajar can cause frost to form in these locations. Another cause may be a faulty door gasket. If the freezer door gasket is dirty or damaged, it can prevent the door from tightly sealing, which causes the room temperature air to leak into the freezer. This issue is easy to fix by either cleaning or replacing the gasket. How to Fix a Freezer Door Gasket The first step is to visually inspect the door gasket and surrounding door area for crumbs, spills, or items that may prevent the door from sealing properly. When inspecting the gasket, check to see if it is torn, warped, or otherwise damaged. If the area is dirty, use a soft, damp cloth to clean up any spills or debris. If the gasket wasn’t damaged, your freezer door should now close properly, preventing any further frost buildup. If the freezer door gasket is cracked or split, it will need to be replaced. The method may vary depending on your freezer model, but it typically requires few or no tools to complete. Frost (or Ice) on the Back Walls The evaporator coils are located behind the back wall of the freezer, and this is typically the coldest spot where frost will form first.",

If a component of the defrost cycle is faulty, it can lead to build-up along the back of the freezer walls. The parts that may be causing this issue are the temperature sensor or thermostat, the heater, or the timer. To see if one of these components has failed, you can use a multimeter to test the part. While the exact location and steps to replace each of these components will vary by make and model, the videos below will provide an overview of the procedure. How to Replace a Defrost Timer The tools you will likely need for this repair may include a Phillips screwdriver, a flathead screwdriver, or a quarter-inch nut driver. If your fridge is not already unplugged from defrosting the freezer, begin your repair by disconnecting the power from the appliance. The defrost timer will be found within the control assembly inside the refrigerator. To remove the control assembly, you may need to remove shelving from the fridge, along with the lightbulb for easier access. You will then need to remove any bolts or screws holding the control housing in place and remove it from the fridge. Place the control assembly on a work surface in order to remove the defrost timer from the housing. To remove the defrost timer, you will need to disconnect the wire harness, and you may need to remove bolts or screws if the timer is secured to the control housing. A flathead screwdriver can be used to remove the wire harness if it is not easy to pull off. The old defrost timer can be discarded, and the new one can be installed by reversing the above steps.",

On the new thermostat, you can cut back some of the wires and strip some of the wire insulation. Join the two sets of wires together by using a wire nut or splice. Electrical tape can then be used to keep the two wires together. With the new thermostat spliced together, it can be reinstalled back on the evaporator. Ice on the Bottom of the Freezer If there is solid ice (not frost) along the bottom of your freezer, there is likely a blockage in the drain hose, causing water to back-flow into the freezer and forming the layer of ice. The line will need to be flushed out, which can be done with compressed air. How to Fix a Blocked Drain Hose If your fridge is not already unplugged from defrosting the freezer, begin your repair by disconnecting power to the appliance. To clear a blocked drain line, we recommend doing so through the external drain outlet with compressed air. This won’t require much air pressure; a bicycle pump will do the trick. Whatever was obstructing the drain line will be blown into the freezer compartment and can be cleaned up from there. With the line now clear, the appliance can be plugged back in, and future ice melting from the defrost cycle should flow down the drain line instead of into the freezer. Practical Tips to Prevent Frost Buildup Now that we’ve solved the most common issues and parts that have caused frost build-up in your freezer and cleared it out, it’s time to make sure it doesn’t happen again. Fortunately, basic changes to some of your daily habits can help prevent future frost or ice buildup in your freezer.",

A hot compressor is typically caused by dirty condenser coils, a malfunctioning fan motor, a faulty thermostat, or low refrigerant levels. It can also be caused by something as simple as overloading the fridge with groceries or placing the fridge too close to the wall. Understanding the root causes of a hot compressor is essential to maintaining your refrigerator’s efficiency and longevity. In this article, we'll explore the common reasons behind a hot refrigerator compressor, and practical step-by-step solutions to help you resolve the issue, and ensure your refrigerator runs smoothly and keeps your food fresh. What Does the Compressor Do in a Refrigerator? The compressor is a crucial part of the refrigeration cycle, which is the process whereby heat is removed from inside the refrigerator to keep it cool. The compressor pressurizes the refrigerant gas, which is converted into a liquid when it passes through the condenser coils. The liquid evaporates and absorbs heat from the interior of the fridge and cools it down. The cooled air is then circulated throughout the refrigerator to keep the food items cold.",
    "Title: Why Your Refrigerator Compressor is Getting Hot. Subtitle: Common Causes and Fixes for an Overheating Compressor. What Does the Compressor Do in a Refrigerator?The gas returns to the compressor where it begins this cycle again. In summary, the compressor is responsible for pressurizing and circulating the refrigerant throughout the refrigeration system and facilitating the removal of heat from inside the refrigerator to the outside environment. If the compressor overheats, it may be unable to compress refrigerant gas effectively, resulting in reduced cooling capacity and longer cooling cycles. It will also consume more energy as it struggles to maintain the desired temperature inside the refrigerator. This can lead to higher electricity bills and unnecessary energy use. Furthermore, overheating over a long period of time can damage the internal components of the compressor, such as the motor windings, and electrical connections. Over time, this can lead to premature compressor failure and the need for costly repairs. If the compressor continues to overheat, it may eventually fail completely. A failed compressor can cause the entire refrigeration system to stop working, leaving your refrigerator unable to function at all. Therefore, if you notice that your compressor is getting hotter than usual, you should address this promptly. How Dirty Refrigerator Condenser Coils Lead to a Hot Compressor The condenser coils are designed to release heat generated from inside the refrigerator. When these coils are covered in dust, dirt, or debris, they will be unable to carry out this function efficiently and the overall temperature of the refrigeration system increases. As a result, the compressor has to work harder and run more frequently to maintain the desired internal temperature.",
    "Title: Why Your Refrigerator Compressor is Getting Hot. Subtitle: Common Causes and Fixes for an Overheating Compressor. What Does the Compressor Do in a Refrigerator?The gas returns to the compressor where it begins this cycle again. In summary, the compressor is responsible for pressurizing and circulating the refrigerant throughout the refrigeration system and facilitating the removal of heat from inside the refrigerator to the outside environment.Over time, this constant strain can cause the compressor to overheat, increase energy costs, and lower the overall efficiency of the refrigerator. How to Clean Condenser Coils to Fix a Hot Compressor Before you begin cleaning, unplug the refrigerator from the power outlet to avoid electric shock. You can typically find the condenser coil either on the back of the refrigerator or underneath the door behind a grille. If the coils are at the bottom, you may need to remove the access panel or grille covering them. This may involve unscrewing a few screws or simply snapping off the grille, depending on your refrigerator model. Once you have access to the coils, use a coil cleaning brush or a vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment to remove any dirt or debris. Be careful to avoid damaging the coils. For any hard-to-reach areas where dust may accumulate, you can use a narrow brush or a can of compressed air to reach these areas. Once the coils are clean and you've inspected them for damage, reassemble any panels or grilles you removed and plug the refrigerator back into the power outlet. How a Faulty Refrigerator Thermostat Leads to a Hot Compressor The thermostat is designed to monitor the internal temperature of the refrigerator and signal the compressor to turn on or off to maintain the correct temperature.

This troubleshooting guide will take your through all of the possible problems and issues, and will ultimately help you get your refrigerator running again. What You Need to Know about Electrical Circuits The first step in understanding the why your refrigerator is tripping your circuit breaker is having a solid understanding of each of the affected components that we'll be talking about in this guide. The following is a glossary of parts and terms to provide you with the knowledge you need to get to work. Circuit : A closed path that allows electricity to flow from one point to another. Circuit Breaker : A safety device designed to interrupt and protect an electrical circuit within equipment and prevent the risk of fire. The breakers within a circuit can be reset to continue the flow of electricity. Fuse : A closed path device that allows electricity to flow between two points, but will break and need replacing after one surge or trip. Fuse Box/Breaker Panel/Junction Box : A electrical panel that contains either fuses or circuit breakers for a building.",

What You Need to Know about Electrical Circuits Why is My Refrigerator Tripping the Breaker?They are designed to provide protection to individual power circuits from being overloaded or shorting to the ground. Wire Harness : An assembly of cables which transmit electrical power. Wall Outlet : An electrical socket that connects an electrical device to an electricity supply. Multimeter : An instrument for measuring electrical properties, like voltage, resistance, and current. Circuit Tripping : When a circuit breaker detects an electrical issue, like an overload or short, and interrupts the flow of electricity to protect the circuit. GFCI Outlet : Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) outlets are an advanced safety device made to monitor and protect a circuit from water or dampness. AFCI Outlet : Arc Fault Circuit Interrupter (AFCI) outlets are electrical devices designed to protect a circuit from electrical fires that stem from arcing faults (discharge of electricity between two conductors). Why is My Refrigerator Tripping the Breaker? The simplest and most common reason a refrigerator, or any appliance, would trip a circuit breaker or fuse box is because it's overloading the overall circuit. Overloading a circuit or fuse means that one appliance or device is drawing too much power it at one given time, compared to the rated capacity of the circuit or fuse. Normally when wiring homes, refrigerators are put on their own designated outlet due to the amount of power they pull, in an effort to curb this from happening. Manufacturers even state that a refrigerator must be on its own independent household circuit, so no other appliance or electrical device should be on the same circuit.",

Wire Harness : An assembly of cables which transmit electrical power. Wall Outlet : An electrical socket that connects an electrical device to an electricity supply.But there are other reasons why a circuit trips, such as faulty wiring from the outlet itself or the refrigerator connected to it, or if an older model refrigerator simply loses its power efficiency over time. How To Find Out if Your Refrigerator is Tripping the Breaker When starting a repair journey like this, it's important to exercise caution whenever dealing with parts in and outside of your refrigerator, especially anything that has an electric current. Remembering to use proper protective equipment, such as insulated work gloves or safety glasses, is important to your safety and wellbeing, and to the overall result of the repair. Inspect the Wall Outlet The first place to inspect if you suspect your refrigerator is tripping your circuit breaker is the wall outlet. To do this, you will need a voltage tester/multimeter that can display the output of the power at the outlet itself. That way you can find out if the outlet is outputting the proper voltage for the fridge and any other appliances that may be connected. When doing this, you should start by looking for visual indications of a problem, specifically signs of arcing or burning around the outlet, because those are clear indications of an issue with the outlet and the power cord of your refrigerator. A worn or defective outlet can cause electricity to arc and potentially burn the outlet, and if there are any damaged or exposed wires on the power cord, the outlet can cause issues with it, too. The power cord for your refrigerator can be replaced if it is found to be the cause of the refrigerators issue.",

What You Need to Know about Electrical Circuits Why is My Refrigerator Tripping the Breaker?They are designed to provide protection to individual power circuits from being overloaded or shorting to the ground. Wire Harness : An assembly of cables which transmit electrical power. Wall Outlet : An electrical socket that connects an electrical device to an electricity supply.Wall outlets are designed to grip the prongs of the cord, and if the prongs are worn or damaged, that grip is lost. If the connection is loose, eventually it will melt the cord and any other plastic (i.e. the outlet cover) in the process. If the connection is poor enough between the prongs and the outlet, electricity will jump the gap and create a spark or arc, which burns even more and accelerates the failure. Test the voltage coming out of the outlet with a voltage tester to ensure you have the proper level between 110-120V. A low voltage will make starting the motor more difficult and could trop a breaker or fuse. If the power cord is severely damaged and wires are exposed, it'll need to be replaced as soon as possible with an OEM cord. To do this, you will need work gloves, and a set of pliers. All you need to do is unplug your fridge and pull it out from the wall until you can access it, then unscrew any cover on the rear of the appliance. Follow the cord to where it connects and remove the clamp securing it. Connect the new one and reinstall the clamp, as well as the rear cover of the fridge, before you plug it back in. Troubleshoot Power Issues With Your Refrigerator If you don't see any issues with your outlet or the surrounding area, it's time to test your refrigerator to see whether the tripping problem is being caused by the appliance. We recommend testing the defrost timer and run capacitor in your refrigerator as your next steps, because it they are more likely to be causing the problem, than the breaker or fuse in your home. It makes sense to test and rule these out before exploring more serious electrical inspections.",

Wire Harness : An assembly of cables which transmit electrical power. Wall Outlet : An electrical socket that connects an electrical device to an electricity supply.To troubleshoot your refrigerator, you will need a clamp multimeter and a line splitting tool to test the current within its power cord. First, you will want to move your refrigerator to a different outlet. This can be an outlet nearby, just as long as your refrigerator is on a different circuit. However, you can also plug your fridge into an extension cord instead of moving it, but the cord needs to be properly rated for 15 or 20A. Ensure your refrigerator is plugged in directly to the line splitting tool and turned on. Plug the line splitting tool into your home's outlet and set your clamp on multimeter, capable of reading household currents, up with the refrigerator's power cord. A line splitting tool is a device that separates hot from neutral and ground wires, so you can measure the current being drawn. Set all temperature settings in the fridge to their lowest (coldest); this is to ensure it does not turn off during testing. Using the clamp multimeter, check the current (amperage) being used by the fridge. If the current being used by the fridge exceeds 15A, the electrical problem lies within the refrigerator. If the current is less than 15A, put your refrigerator into defrosting mode. Models with timers can be advanced to initiate a defrost, whereas electronic control boards will require a specific set of steps to initiate a defrost cycle for testing. Since these steps can vary by make and manufacturer, you will need to find this information in your owner's manual or online. Check the current reading again with your multimeter and if it exceeds 15A, the problem is with the fridge.",

Wire Harness : An assembly of cables which transmit electrical power. Wall Outlet : An electrical socket that connects an electrical device to an electricity supply.If after you've tested the fridge, the current does not exceed 15A, the circuitry issue is with your home. This could be an issue with a weak break, or a worn fuse holder, if your home has screw-in fuses. How to Fix a Refrigerator that Keeps Shorting For a refrigerator that's pulling too much power from the wall outlet and overloading the circuit, you will need to troubleshoot and potentially replace one of two parts in your fridge; the compressor's run capacitor, or the defrost timer or control board (depending on your fridge model). If your fridge model is from before 2000 you will likely have a defrost timer, if your model is from 2000-2015 you could have either, and if your fridge was made in the last 10 years (2015 onwards), it likely has a defrost unit within the control board. As we explain below, these parts are essential to the overall function of the refrigerator, and when they fail they can cause the trip you are experiencing. We walk you through how to identify which of these parts is causing the problem in your refrigerator, and we explain how to replace them to get your appliance running! How to Replace a Refrigerator's Defrost Timer or Heater The defrost timer and control board and heater are, as their name implies, responsible for the cooling and defrosting process of the refrigerator, which are determined either by a length of time, continuous or while the compressor runs, or by the number of times the doors are opened.",

Continue reading to find out how to replace or test your defrost timer or heater! Unplug your refrigerator from its wall outlet. Open your freezer compartment and locate the heater. It's usually behind the back panel of the freezer section. Anything in the way will need to be removed, like the food items and contents of your freezer, and parts like the ice maker, and then finally the cover panel. This will all depend on your model and the features it includes. Use a screwdriver to unthread any securing screws or clips, and then remove the cover. Use a set of pliers to disconnect the wires for the heater. Using a multimeter, set it to RX1 and place a lead on each of the terminals. If the reading is zero or infinity, replace it. If not, reinstall it and test your defrost timer instead. If your defrost heater was the issue, remove the old one and replace it with the new one, and then carefully reassemble your freezer compartment. Then plug your fridge back in and monitor it. If the defrost heater is not the issue, you will need to inspect and potentially replace the defrost timer or control board, depending on your refrigerator model. If your model has a control board instead of a timer, you will need to test the relay board. A relay board will either be built into the back of the fridge (and can only be accessed by pulling the fridge out from the wall) or will be in the same place as the control board.",

Wire Harness : An assembly of cables which transmit electrical power. Wall Outlet : An electrical socket that connects an electrical device to an electricity supply.To find the timer or control board in your fridge you will need to locate the control panel, since these parts are attached to the control panel. Depending on the model, it'll be in a number of places. The most common location for control panels would be in the back of the appliance near the top, or on the ceiling of the fridge compartment, behind the kick plate at the bottom of your fridge, or down by the compressor at the rear of the fridge. Use a screwdriver to unthread the control panel and open it. Disconnect the wire harness of the control panel to the fridge. Use a screwdriver to disconnect the defrost timer and heater from its assembly. Whether you have a timer or control board, testing it for continuity is the same. Using a multimeter, set it to the X1 setting for Ohm's and connect a probe to each terminal. If there is no continuity, replace the timer immediately. Install the new timer and any wires connected to it. Connect the control panel's wire harness to the fridge and rethread the securing screws. Plug your fridge back in and monitor it. Note : To ensure that your relay or control board is bad/faulty, have them diagnosed by a qualified technician before purchasing a new one to replace it. How to Replace a Refrigerator Compressor's Capacitor A fridge compressor's capacitor , also known as a relay, is what assists in turning the compressor on and off, depending on the cooling needed. But if the capacitor fails from old age or an electrical surge, it will no longer operate properly and it will overload its outlet, which leads to a short and tripped circuit.",

Wire Harness : An assembly of cables which transmit electrical power. Wall Outlet : An electrical socket that connects an electrical device to an electricity supply.If you listen carefully, a failed capacitor will cause the compressor to click when it overloads the circuit. The capacitor will be located at the bottom rear portion of the refrigerator, and can be tested and replaced easily with a set of pliers, screwdriver, wrench, multimeter, and work gloves. Read along and we'll explain exactly how to fix your compressor. Unplug your refrigerator from the wall outlet. Pull your fridge out from the wall, and remove its back panel with a screwdriver or wrench. Locate the capacitor and discharge any potentially stored electricity from it. This can be done by putting a metal object, like a screwdriver, across the two terminals of the capacitor. Remove any harnesses connected to it with a set of pliers. Carefully remove the old capacitor. Use a multimeter in Ohms mode to test it for continuity by touching the probes to the terminals. Ideally the resistance will rise and then fall back to zero, but if it rises and stays, the capacitor is shorted. If it does not rise at all, it is open and needs to be replaced. To replace it, simply install the new capacitor in the old one's place, and reinstall the wiring harnesses by plugging them onto the capacitor. Replace the back panel of the fridge, and plug it back in. Let it run for a few minutes and take note of anything that happens. Why Your Outlet Keeps Tripping Now that we have ruled out the refrigerator and the outlet it's plugged into, there are a couple more complex issues that could be causing the power to continually trip. We'll walk you through each of those reasons, and what your next steps should be.",

Wire Harness : An assembly of cables which transmit electrical power. Wall Outlet : An electrical socket that connects an electrical device to an electricity supply.Improperly Routed Wire Harness Electrical wiring can be complicated, especially for an appliance like a refrigerator. This becomes even more of a nuisance when the problem with an appliance like a refrigerator lies within its wire harnesses. Even though it's a rarity, an incorrectly or improperly routed wire that comes into contact with another wire, can cause one or both to melt and cause a short within the refrigerator's circuit as a result. And in some cases, rodents will find their way into the compressor compartment and chew on the wires, creating a possibility of shorting or overheating. The only way you'd be able to find this issue, however, is by visually inspecting your refrigerator's wires and ensuring such a short does not exist. If you're not comfortable investigating your fridge's circuitry, consider contacting a repair technician to investigate your refrigerator for a short or other issue with its circuitry. Issues with GFCI Outlets Depending on how recently your home was built, a GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter) outlet in your home may be tripping from a grounding issue. A grounding issue, or 'fault', happens when the electrical current from your home follows an unintended path to the ground (i.e. damaged wiring, moisture infiltration, etc.). It's worth noting though, that GFCI outlets are not commonly used for circuits with a fridge because they need to be accessible, so you can quickly and easily access them if they trip. This outlet can be replaced with an AFCI outlet, however, it's important to get a qualified electrician's opinion on your home's electrical layout before doing anything yourself.",

Wire Harness : An assembly of cables which transmit electrical power. Wall Outlet : An electrical socket that connects an electrical device to an electricity supply.What to Do if Your Outlet Keeps Tripping If you've inspected your fridge's wiring and your GFCI outlet has no indications of any damage or issue and is still tripping, there are a couple of ways to circumvent your outlet tripping and to get your fridge back and operational again, without needing any tools. Switch the Refrigerator Outlet One proven way to identify any electrical issues you're having with a refrigerator, or any appliance, is to switch its outlet. Whether it's some electrical interference, or if the outlet itself just isn't grabbing and supporting the refrigerator's power cord for any number of reasons, switching the outlet it's plugged into can allow your refrigerator to run, and pinpoint the problem to the outlet itself. Use an Extension Cord Adding on to the idea of switching outlets, if you need an extension cord to reach a different outlet, use one! But make sure of the extension cord's current rating. The cord will need to have a rating for 15 or 20A to handle the electric current from the wall outlet to the refrigerator without issue. If you've been using an extension cord for your refrigerator and it's not rated to handle 15 or 20A, replace it with one that can immediately. Using an extension cord with too low of an amperage compared to the amperage necessary for the appliance will cause an overload, and lead to the outlet tripping and potentially causing a fire. Now that your refrigerator is fully back and operational, hopefully you can get back to being able to properly store your food and keep it fresh for longer, without the worry of your fridge turning off or circuit tripping.",

Very Loud Hum: If your refrigerator is consistently producing a loud hum or buzz noise from its bottom and/or rear side, it means the compressor is likely failing and in need of service or replacement. A hum of this level will usually only come from an older refrigerator model, since most fridge models last between 15-20 years. How to Fix a Refrigerator Evaporator Fan to Solve Loud Humming Noises If the evaporator fan in your refrigerator is blocked by ice, if its airway is blocked by food items, or if its motor is bad and needs replacing, your refrigerator will begin to hum or buzz loudly. Luckily, the evaporator can be fixed, and doing so is a repair that anyone can do! Remove Food Items from Evaporator Fan Depending on your refrigerator model, food items can block and clog the airway of the evaporator fan, preventing it from properly distributing cool air within the cabinet of the refrigerator and causing both the compressor and evaporator to work harder and hum or buzz distinctly loud. Simply moving food out of the way of the fan and clearing off any built-up frost should fix the humming and noise issue. Thaw and Remove Ice from Evaporator Fan Evaporator fans help maintain the internal temperature in your refrigerator. They pull warm air from the appliance through the evaporator coils to cool it. Depending on the model of refrigerator, the evaporator fan motor may also be used to circulate that cooled air.",

Quick Ice Maker Fixes Parts to Examine to Fix Your Ice Maker How to Replace a Clogged or After-Market Water Filter How to Replace a Broken Fridge Door Switch How to Replace a Refrigerator Water Inlet Valve How to Fix a Broken Fridge Ice Dispenser Actuator Why is My Ice Maker is Still Not Working? Trying to dispense some cold ice into your beverage of choice, but your ice maker isn't working? There are a few reasons why your ice maker isn't working properly, some are easy fixes, and others require parts and tools! You can start by lowering the temperature of your freezer to below 0°F/-18°C, ensuring the shutoff switch/arm is not engaged, or emptying the ice maker bin. Then you can check the ejector fingers, water supply and tube, and infrared sensor to ensure those are not the cause. Finally, it's important to troubleshoot key parts like the water filter, door switch, ice dispenser paddles and water inlet valve if basic troubleshooting does not solve the issue. Whether it's a quick and easy fix, or a faulty part, we have the guide to walk you the steps required to get your ice maker up and running again! Quick Ice Maker Fixes Ice makers can be finicky, since they rely on consistently cold temperatures and key mechanical functions to turn over continuously day and night, making ice. Unfortunately, these functions can be interrupted by any slight fluctuation or disruption. However, the good news is these issue are often just as easy to fix as they are to occur. The following are the simplest common fixes to an ice maker that isn't functioning: Shutoff Arm/Switch is Not Engaged: The shutoff arm/switch in many freezer compartments directly activates and deactivates the ice maker, and can accidentally be lodged into an, 'OFF' position. This switch is normally behind or around the ice bin, however your model may be different. Simply turn this arm/switch to the correct position to turn it on again.",

Trying to dispense some cold ice into your beverage of choice, but your ice maker isn't working?Ice Maker Bin is Frozen: Referred to as, 'compacting', this is when a lack of movement, production or proper cleaning of the ice bin leads to it clumping together and freezing into a solid block. This results in the ice maker appearing to be broken, when in reality, the old ice just needs to be thrown out. Temperature of Freezer is too High: When a freezer compartment's temperature is too warm or too cold, it can result in too small of ice or ice not being produced at all, or it can result in the entire ice bin freezing and being difficult to separate. Using a thermometer, you can test the internal temperature of the freezer compartment to ensure it's 0°F/-18°C or slightly colder. If the internal temperature is too high or too cold, use your fridge controls to adjust the temperature. Frozen Water Supply: The water supply tube within an ice maker system is responsible for delivering water to the ice maker to freeze. This tube can freeze when there's a momentary lack of water pressure, a clogged water filter within the fridge, or a lapse within the temperature control of the freezer. However, if you pull out the ice bin, and using a hair dryer or similar tool, you can apply heat to the tube and de-thaw it, allowing the water to flow freely again. Note: Move the hair dryer and apply heat indirectly, since too much direct heat may cause the plastic to melt. Sometimes fixing your ice maker isn't as easy as the four methods described above.",

Trying to dispense some cold ice into your beverage of choice, but your ice maker isn't working?The following issues may require more time to fix, but are just as important to the functionality of your ice maker: Ejector Fingers: In some fridge models a mechanism called, ejector 'fingers' – also known as bar, tines, or paddles – is used to eject the frozen ice created by the ice maker into the ice bin. This mechanism can become jammed and will require you to break-up the ice to become unstuck. Clogged or Kinked Water Tube: A clogged or kinked water supply tube to your fridge will inevitably and naturally cause the ice maker to stop producing ice. If the temperature in your fridge is suitable and it suddenly stops producing ice, check the water supply tube for any clogs, kinks, or damage. Infrared Sensor Out of Position: In some Samsung refrigerator models, infrared sensors are used to detect when more ice needs to be made, and when it needs to stop. If the sensor is dislodged, it will inaccurately detect ice and cause the ice maker to stop. Simply remove any built-up or lodged ice, and the sensor should restore functionality to the ice maker. Parts to Examine to Fix Your Ice Maker If you've tried all of the above methods, and your ice maker is still not producing ice or working properly, you likely have the bigger task ahead of you – replacing a part. We understand that this is not good news, but we have the step-by-step guide you need to properly repair your fridge, and get cold ice now! How to Replace a Clogged or After-Market Water Filter Water filters are used for the dispensing of water and the creation of ice in the ice maker.",

Trying to dispense some cold ice into your beverage of choice, but your ice maker isn't working?If your filter is clogged or is an after-market variant, it will need to be replaced with an OEM filter immediately. Locating the filter in your refrigerator can depend on the model, however, key places to look for are the ceiling of the fridge's interior, as well as the bottom of the appliance or corners. You can find the OEM filter for your fridge model in our PartSelect water filter finder! Water filters should be changed every 6–9 months for best water taste and appearance. Not changing your water filter will cause sediments and other normally filtered elements and minerals from entering your water and eventually, your body. The following video guide has more in-depth instructions for you to follow concerning your fridge's water filter. How to Replace a Broken Fridge Door Switch On either side of your refrigerator will be a door switch that either activates or deactivates any cooling or ice/water production when the door is opened. If the switch responsible for that ice and water production is bad or defective, which can be detected by the light properly turning on when the door is opened, it will cause your ice maker to stop working properly. Luckily, we have a wide-range of switches in our PartSelect refrigerator switch inventory , and a general guide to tell you how to replace it: Disconnect your refrigerator from its wall outlet to turn it off. Use two flat tools, such as a putty-knife and flat-head screwdriver, to pry the switch out from the interior wall of the freezer. Using a set of pliers, pull the switch out from its housing and disconnect any connected wire harnesses.",

Connect your refrigerator back to its wall outlet and test the door and ice maker after 10–15 minutes. Note : If your refrigerator has not made ice in a significant amount of time, give it up to 24 hours to produce ice. Below is a general video guide to instruct you on this repair. How to Replace a Refrigerator Water Inlet Valve Solenoid water inlet valves are used within refrigerators and appliances in general to activate to allow water to flow freely and contain filters to keep out any dirt or debris that could be in your water supply. If a water inlet valve is bad or becomes clogged and needs replacement, it will cause the water or ice dispenser in your refrigerator to have a weak level of pressure and not dispense or produce water and ice. However, you can find the OEM water inlet valve for your refrigerator model in our PartSelect inventory, and use the following general guide to remove and replace it: Turn off and disconnect your fridge from its water and power supply. Locate the inlet valve and remove any panels that may be securing it. Unthread any securing screws holding the valve in place, and pull the valve out.

Are the Fans and Compressor Running? The Controls The Start Device or Relay Overload Device Inverter Drive Style Compressors The Compressor How to Set the Temperature in Your Fridge If your refrigerator isn’t cooling, there are a few components that may be causing this symptom. Follow along to find out what these components are, how to locate them, and how to test them. Once your refrigerator temperatures have normalized, we’ll walk you through how to make temperature adjustments based on your preferences. Is Your Refrigerator Getting Power? Your first step in diagnosing your refrigerator is to determine whether you have power to the refrigerator. To check this, open the door and see if the internal lights come on. If so, we know we do have power to the appliance, and now we can move on to the next step. If no lights come on this means they have either burnt out or the receptacle itself may have no power to it. You will want to plug in another appliance into the receptacle to verify whether you have power or not. Are the Fans and Compressor Running? The Controls Your next step will be to determine whether the fan in the refrigerator and the compressor are running. If you don’t hear any fans running, this may indicate that you have a problem with the controls. On a standard refrigerator with a dial-type control or a slide-type control, there is essentially an on/off switch that turns power on to the compressor and the fans. If neither of those is running, the problem is likely with the control. With models that use electronic controls, you’ll either need a good understanding of how those controls work or you’ll need to contact a technician to troubleshoot it further. The Start Device or Relay Overload Device If the fans on your refrigerator are running but not the compressor, it is likely a problem with the start device for that compressor. Most compressors use either a relay overload device or a start device.",
    "Title: Why is my Refrigerator Not Cooling?. Subtitle: Troubleshooting a Refrigerator That Won't Cool and How to Set the Temperature. Is Your Refrigerator Getting Power? Are the Fans and Compressor Running? The Controls The Start Device or Relay Overload Device Inverter Drive Style Compressors The Compressor How to Set the Temperature in Your Fridge If your refrigerator isn’t cooling, there are a few components that may be causing this symptom.To get the compressor running, those components can usually be tested with a multimeter to check for their proper function. Without the start device working properly, the compressor may not start and therefore you would not get any cooling. Most of these are easily checked with a multimeter. You will just pull the device completely off the compressor to test. Relay Start Device Components: Capacitor It may be called either a run capacitor or a start capacitor. The only thing that can be checked is whether it has shorted or not. Usually, the numbers on the multimeter rapidly change and then go to an overscale condition or an overload condition. Overload The purpose of the overload is to protect the compressor from starting and stopping mid-cycle with pressure built up. There should be continuity between the two sets of terminals on that device. One terminal that attaches to the compressor and the external terminal. They should show somewhere close to zero ohms. Relay The purpose of the relay portion of the device is to activate both the start and run windings on the compressor. Once the compressor comes up to speed the start winding will get dropped out so that it does not draw too much current. Typically, they will use some type of thermistor or varistor device internally. There will be some continuity between these two terminals. If there isn’t, you can assume that the device is defective. There are different types of relays, and the more modern ones with the electronic control boards internally can be very difficult to check with a multimeter without extensive knowledge of how that circuit works.",

Are the Fans and Compressor Running? The Controls The Start Device or Relay Overload Device Inverter Drive Style Compressors The Compressor How to Set the Temperature in Your Fridge If your refrigerator isn’t cooling, there are a few components that may be causing this symptom.Inverter Drive Style Compressors Lastly, you may find that your refrigerator has an inverter drive style compressor, which would have a box mounted to the side of the compressor. This performs the same function as the start device with the exception that it can also operate a variable speed compressor. Again, these are very difficult devices to troubleshoot without extensive knowledge of the circuits. The Compressor The last check would be on the compressor itself. You can test the internal windings on that compressor to verify that they’re in working order. You’ll find three male pins on the side of that compressor. Typically, the one at the top would be the common terminal and the other two would represent both the start and run windings. Measuring between the common terminal and each of the remaining two terminals would indicate that they all have continuity. The start winding will generally have a higher resistance than the run winding. You will also want to look for any continuity between the three pins and ground on the case of the compressor. Make sure that there is no continuity between any of those terminals. If so, the compressor is shorted and would need to be replaced, which would require a certified technician to do that repair. If both the evaporator and condenser fans are running and the compressor is running, and you are still not getting any cooling in your refrigerator, you can suspect that you have a seal system problem. That will require a qualified technician to perform a proper diagnosis.",

Are the Fans and Compressor Running? The Controls The Start Device or Relay Overload Device Inverter Drive Style Compressors The Compressor How to Set the Temperature in Your Fridge If your refrigerator isn’t cooling, there are a few components that may be causing this symptom.How to Set the Temperature in Your Fridge Once you have the cooling back up and running, you may wonder what the best temperature is to keep your refrigerator, and how to make those adjustments based on your preferences. Continue reading for tips on making those correct temperature adjustments or check out our video below. Most manufacturers will have a recommended default setting for their models. For fresh-food temperature, that can range anywhere from 35 to 38 degrees Fahrenheit, and a freezer temperature anywhere from 0 to plus 10 degrees Fahrenheit. They are all adjustable to your own preference, however, we do caution that if you set your refrigerator controls too cold, you do run the risk of food freezing in the fresh-food compartment, also causing your refrigerator to run longer and use more energy. If you set your controls to too high of a setting, you also run the risk of food spoiling. There are several styles of controls to adjust these temperatures, and we’ll give you an example of these and how to adjust them for your model. Most refrigerators that have two or more doors will have two or more controls to operate them. Typically, there will be one for the freezer and one for the fresh-food compartment. On the models we show in our video as an example, one of the controls turns the compressor on and off based on its specific temperature. The other control varies how much air comes from the freezer into the fresh-food compartment.",

Are the Fans and Compressor Running? The Controls The Start Device or Relay Overload Device Inverter Drive Style Compressors The Compressor How to Set the Temperature in Your Fridge If your refrigerator isn’t cooling, there are a few components that may be causing this symptom.The controls on most fridges will either be a numbered scale, a name scale (cold, colder, coldest), or you may even find some models that display the ambient temperature in both the fresh food and freezer compartments. If your model does not have an ambient temperature indicated, but you do want to know what the temperature is, you’ll need to use a quality thermometer. Immerse it in a jar of liquid, in your fresh-food compartment or a semi-solid substance in your freezer, to get an accurate temperature. If you have decided that the manufacturer’s recommended settings aren’t to your preference, and have decided to make a change, keep in mind that whichever control you adjust, the fresh-food or the freezer temperature, this will affect both compartments. Also, remember that it takes about 24 hours for temperatures to stabilize in your refrigerator after you make an adjustment.

    "Title: Why Isn't My Refrigerator Icemaker Working?. Subtitle: Troubleshooting Tips and How it Works. Symptom 1: No Ice Cubes are Being Produced Bail arm Icemaker control Symptom 2: Ice Cubes are too Small Water line restriction Symptom 3: Ice Cubes are too Large Fill valve Symptom 4: Ice Bin Overflows Bail Arm Icemaker Head Symptom 5: No Cubes in the Mold Fill Tube/Fill Valve There are a variety of reasons a refrigerator icemaker may not be working as it should. As we aim to answer the most common symptom questions and solutions, we will also cover how the icemaker works and the main components to be aware of as you try and troubleshoot your own appliance. Regardless of the style of refrigerator you have, whether it be French door style, bottom mount, side-by-side, top-mount, if it is a heat release icemaker , it probably resembles one of three units (seen in the image below). All three units will have similar components of an icemaker, which we will explain as we go through each symptom. Components of an Icemaker: The mold (where the ice cubes form) Heater (embedded in the mold) Eject arm Bail/shut-off arm Control (located on the front) Harness connector (these can come in different styles) Shut-off lever (can vary depending on the brand) How Does a Heat Release Icemaker Work? The heat-release icemaker works by partially filling with water, and as the icemaker is sitting in the freezer, eventually that water will freeze and turn to ice. When that happens, a thermostat that is located on the front end of that mold will detect the temperature. Once it detects a certain temperature, it will close the circuit. In the control section, this turns on a motor, and this will rotate the ejector arm, which will rotate down on top of the ice cubes. The ejector arm will then just sit there and put pressure on the ice cubes. At the same time the motor is operating, on the bottom side of the icemaker, embedded into the mold itself, is an electric heater. The heater is turned on at the same time and will slowly warm up that mold. Once it reaches a certain temperature, this breaks the bond between the ice cube and the interior surface of the mold.",

At the same time that this is happening, as the ice cubes are fully ejected, the water valve that is located at the back of the refrigerator (single or two coil, or in the case of some models that use dispensers and filters, they may have as many as 3-4 solenoid coils), will turn on the coil that affects the icemaker, water will enter the cup at the rear of the ice maker or through the back , and it will run for a specific amount of time until it fills that mold to the proper level. The mold will sit there and wait for the process to start all over again. Why Isn’t my Icemaker Working? Now that you have a basic idea of how an icemaker works, lets dive into some of the symptoms that may occur and troubleshoot what could go wrong with your icemaker. Symptom 1: No Ice Cubes are Being Produced Bail arm Make sure the bail arm is not locked in the off position (this applies to a drop-down bail type or a slide-open type shut off lever). It should be in the down position, which will turn on the icemaker control, allowing it to harvest ice cubes as they become frozen. Icemaker control If the bail arm is working properly, the problem may be with the internal switch located on the control arm. It is operated by the bail arm, which fits into a slotted opening on the control, and this controls the set of contacts located underneath. When the bail arm is in the \"on\" position, one set of contacts is closed, and when it is in the off position, a separate set of contacts are closed.",

Symptom 1: No Ice Cubes are Being Produced Bail arm Icemaker control Symptom 2: Ice Cubes are too Small Water line restriction Symptom 3: Ice Cubes are too Large Fill valve Symptom 4: Ice Bin Overflows Bail Arm Icemaker Head Symptom 5: No Cubes in the Mold Fill Tube/Fill Valve There are a variety of reasons a refrigerator icemaker may not be working as it should.If the contacts fail to make it into the \"on\" position, the icemaker will not harvest any cubes. The components of the control are not serviceable, so if the issue is here, the entire control will need to be replaced. Symptom 2: Ice Cubes are too Small Water line restriction If the ice cubes are too small that would be an indication that not enough water is getting into the mold. There is no float that governs the level of water in that mold, it is completely controlled by the amount of time that the water valve is turned on, which is controlled by the icemaker control at the front. It is adjustable to a certain extent and typically somewhere between seven to ten seconds of fill time through the water valve, will give an adequate amount of time to fill the mold. Before making any adjustments, if it has been working fine all along, chances are it is not the control that is giving you the problem, it is likely a restriction in the water line going to the icemaker. Symptom 3: Ice Cubes are too Large Fill valve The most common reason for ice cubes being too large is the fill valve is staying on longer than power is being applied to it. This is a mechanical problem with the fill valve, making it so it does not shut off right away, allowing too much water in. This is usually caused by dirt getting inside of the valve, and the only way to correct this, is to replace it. Symptom 4: Ice Bin Overflows Bail Arm The bail arm may be the incorrect one for your model. If you have recently replaced the bail arm, and are having this issue, double check that you have the correct part for your specific model.",

If this does not happen because the bail arm is not the correct one, and doesn’t drop down far enough, you will get a bin that fills up with too much ice. Icemaker Head If there is a defect with the icemaker head, it will make it so the icemaker does not shut off. Symptom 5: No Cubes in the Mold This symptom might also cause water to splash over the actual ice bin and freeze the cubes together. Fill Tube/Fill Valve The fill tube brings water into the fill cup and if this freezes up, water will splash everywhere, and none will get down into the mold itself. This is usually caused by the fill valve .

Wait until the freezer comes down to temperature before replacing your food items. Frost on the Freezer Walls or Door If you have frost throughout the freezer, such as along the walls and even on the door, this is due to warm, humid air entering the freezer. Simple things like opening the freezer door too frequently, placing hot food in the freezer, or leaving the door ajar can cause frost to form in these locations. Another cause may be a faulty door gasket. If the freezer door gasket is dirty or damaged, it can prevent the door from tightly sealing, which causes the room temperature air to leak into the freezer. This issue is easy to fix by either cleaning or replacing the gasket. How to Fix a Freezer Door Gasket The first step is to visually inspect the door gasket and surrounding door area for crumbs, spills, or items that may prevent the door from sealing properly. When inspecting the gasket, check to see if it is torn, warped, or otherwise damaged. If the area is dirty, use a soft, damp cloth to clean up any spills or debris. If the gasket wasn’t damaged, your freezer door should now close properly, preventing any further frost buildup. If the freezer door gasket is cracked or split, it will need to be replaced. The method may vary depending on your freezer model, but it typically requires few or no tools to complete. Frost (or Ice) on the Back Walls The evaporator coils are located behind the back wall of the freezer, and this is typically the coldest spot where frost will form first.",

If a component of the defrost cycle is faulty, it can lead to build-up along the back of the freezer walls. The parts that may be causing this issue are the temperature sensor or thermostat, the heater, or the timer. To see if one of these components has failed, you can use a multimeter to test the part. While the exact location and steps to replace each of these components will vary by make and model, the videos below will provide an overview of the procedure. How to Replace a Defrost Timer The tools you will likely need for this repair may include a Phillips screwdriver, a flathead screwdriver, or a quarter-inch nut driver. If your fridge is not already unplugged from defrosting the freezer, begin your repair by disconnecting the power from the appliance. The defrost timer will be found within the control assembly inside the refrigerator. To remove the control assembly, you may need to remove shelving from the fridge, along with the lightbulb for easier access. You will then need to remove any bolts or screws holding the control housing in place and remove it from the fridge. Place the control assembly on a work surface in order to remove the defrost timer from the housing. To remove the defrost timer, you will need to disconnect the wire harness, and you may need to remove bolts or screws if the timer is secured to the control housing.

Electrical tape can then be used to keep the two wires together. With the new thermostat spliced together, it can be reinstalled back on the evaporator. Ice on the Bottom of the Freezer If there is solid ice (not frost) along the bottom of your freezer, there is likely a blockage in the drain hose, causing water to back-flow into the freezer and forming the layer of ice. The line will need to be flushed out, which can be done with compressed air. How to Fix a Blocked Drain Hose If your fridge is not already unplugged from defrosting the freezer, begin your repair by disconnecting power to the appliance. To clear a blocked drain line, we recommend doing so through the external drain outlet with compressed air. This won’t require much air pressure; a bicycle pump will do the trick. Whatever was obstructing the drain line will be blown into the freezer compartment and can be cleaned up from there. With the line now clear, the appliance can be plugged back in, and future ice melting from the defrost cycle should flow down the drain line instead of into the freezer. Practical Tips to Prevent Frost Buildup Now that we’ve solved the most common issues and parts that have caused frost build-up in your freezer and cleared it out, it’s time to make sure it doesn’t happen again.

    "Title: Why Is My Dishwasher Stopping Mid-Cycle?. Subtitle: These three common problem areas may be the reason!. Reason One: Door Latch Assembly Reason Two: Door Catch Reason Three: Control Board So you finally get your dishes loaded up, start the washer and then come back only to find half-washed dishes. What happened? Well if your dishwasher is stopping mid-cycle there are a few common reasons why this may be occurring. For a full visual guide, please see the following video or read our written guide below. Reason One: Door Latch Assembly This is the most common cause of a dishwasher stopping mid-cycle. The Door Latch Assembly is used to hold the door closed during the cycle to keep water from leaking, and it contains one or two switches that supply power to the controls. If the latch assembly is broken or damaged it won’t keep the door closed, and therefore your system will shut down. Reason Two: Door Catch The catch is a part of your dishwasher frame which connects to the Door Latch Assembly. If this is broken the same problem will occur. Namely that the door won’t stay closed and the machine will shut down. To check the catch, you can simply look at it, and ensure that it is firmly attached to the tub. Some models have adjustable \"mounting screws\". Check your owners manual to find out if you have this kind of model, and how to access the mounting screws. If you have this kind of model, adjust the screws until the door is held securely. If the part appears broken, replace it. Reason Three: Control Board If your assembly and door catch are working properly then it’s possible that the internal electronic components of the washer to fail and prevent your dishwasher from changing cycles. In this case, it will likely need to be replaced. Contact your manufacturer for details on how to replace or repair this issue.

To make it easier for you, we put together a guide covering the 6 most common noises made by dishwashers, as well as how to fix each type of noise: Grinding Sounds If you're hearing grinding, something may be stuck in the chopper blade area of the dishwasher. To inspect the chopper, remove the cover on the bottom of the inside of the dishwasher. Be sure to clean both the chopper area as well as the manual filter. Shop Replacement Dishwasher Choppers > Thumping Sounds Generally, these are nothing to be overly concerned about as they're simple and easy to fix! First, open your dishwasher and be sure that no items are hanging down below either rack. If they are, it's likely that the rotating spray arm is contacting them and causing the thumping sound. If no dishes are contacting the spray arm, your next step should be to check the drain hose as it may be thumping against the cabinet as it drains. To fix this issue, simply pull the dishwasher out to reposition the hose so it doesn't come into contact with any other surfaces, and the sound should disappear! Shop Replacement Dishwasher Drain Hoses > Loud Buzzing Sounds The most likely cause of loud buzzing noises is an obstructed/dirty drain or wash pump. Refer to your owner’s manual for the exact locations and removal methods, but they most likely located on the back of the dishwasher, near the top. Inspect both the washer to ensure nothing is obstructing the areas and they are clean from debris. If there are no obstructions, it may be necessary to replace them.

    "Title: Why is My Refrigerator So Noisy?. Subtitle: Diagnose & Repair Your Fridge. Condenser Fan Motor Assembly Evaporator Fan Motor & Blade Compressor Water Inlet Valve Wrap-up A refrigerator that is making more noise than it should is typically signaling that something is amiss. Fixing your refrigerator yourself, rather than hiring an expensive repair tech can save you time and money! One of the most common sounds to come from a refrigerator is a cracking or popping noise, which is usually the result of components and panels of the fridge contracting and expanding in response to a temperature change. This is particularly common in fridges that are “frost-free”. However, in addition to “regular” noises made by your refrigerator, a strange noise coming from the appliance could suggest that one or more parts are defective. Which is why you should always inspect the following parts prior to assuming they are routine noises: Condenser Fan Motor Assembly One of the most common causes of noise from your refrigerator is the condenser fan motor assembly. It is located at the back of the refrigerator, close to the floor, and typically is behind a cardboard or metal access panel. To inspect it, you want to look for a damaged fan blade with any part of the blade bent, distorted, or missing. You'll also want to check to make sure that it is tight on the motor shaft and that the motor shaft is not loose in the motor bushings. Shop Replacement Condenser Fan Motor Assemblies > Evaporator Fan Motor & Blade Another common cause for noise in a refrigerator is the evaporator fan motor. The evaporator fan motor is located next to the evaporator in the freezer section and there's usually a metal cover in front of it. To inspect it, first make sure that there's nothing that has gotten into the vent area that may be interfering with the blade. Then remove that cover to inspect the evaporator fan motor and blade assembly. Verify that that blade turns freely and is not damaged, that the motor is mounted firmly in the bracket, and that the shaft is nice and snug with no excess play in it.",

Fixing your refrigerator yourself, rather than hiring an expensive repair tech can save you time and money!Shop Replacement Evaporator Fan Motor & Blades > Compressor A less common cause for noise in a refrigerator could be related to the compressor. Unlike an evaporator fan or condenser fan motor noise, which typically has a consistent ticking sound or a scraping sound, a compressor noise is more likely to be a knocking sound that might occur when the compressor starts, and perhaps again when it shuts off. The compressor is typically located at the rear of the refrigerator, close to the bottom, and would be located behind an access panel. To inspect it, verify that the rubber mounts on the bottom are intact and not damaged. If you have a sound similar to a knocking sound that occurs once when the compressor starts and again when it ends, you may have a defect inside of the compressor with the suspension springs. Shop Replacement Compressors > Water Inlet Valve Another less common cause for noise in a refrigerator could be related to a water valve. Models with an ice maker or an ice and water dispenser through the door will have a water valve located at the back of the refrigerator. To inspect it, remove the rear panel, locate the valve, and determine if the noise is coming from the valve. If it is, determine how frequently it is making the noise. If you hear a loud buzzing sound once every three or four hours, that would typically indicate that the ice makers portion of that valve is defective. If you only hear it when you dispense water through the front, it would indicate that the dispenser portion is defective.",

    "Title: Why Is My Refrigerator Freezing My Food?. How Does a Refrigerator Work? Thermostat Control Damper Control Electronic Control Conclusion If your refrigerator is freezing food, then it's not doing its job – there's a freezer for that! But if your fridge is freezing your food, it doesn't mean you need a new fridge. Usually, this issue can be easily diagnosed and repaired. In this article, we'll explain how the refrigeration system works, some of the reasons why food may be freezing in the fresh food section, and what parts you may need to replace to fix your refrigerator. How Does a Refrigerator Work? The basic operation of a refrigerator is such that we have an evaporator, which is where the cooling portion of the system takes place. It will be located in the freezer, whether it's a side-by-side, or top-mount, or a bottom-mount refrigerator. Air from the freezer is then circulated into the fresh food compartment and back into the freezer in a continuous circulation. Typically, we would see about 80% of the air stay inside of the freezer and about 20% go into the fresh food compartment. With that ratio, we typically will get a temperature range of about 0 to +5 Fahrenheit in the freezer and about 36 to 38 degrees Fahrenheit in the fresh food section. Thermostat Control If your fresh food section is cooler than that, you may have a problem with the thermostat control, that's the device that turns the compressor on and off. That thermostat monitors the temperature of the air, either in the freezer or in the fresh food compartment, depending on the model. The typical hydraulic control for a refrigerator consists of a capillary tube that senses the temperature and a set of electrical contacts enclosed in a casing. If it becomes defective, it is a non-serviceable item and will need to be replaced. Before replacing the thermostat control, verify that somebody hasn't inadvertently turned the temperature up too cold. Set it back to the manufacturer's recommended setting, and allow about 24 hours for the temperatures to stabilize in your refrigerator.",

Thermostat Control Damper Control Electronic Control Conclusion If your refrigerator is freezing food, then it's not doing its job – there's a freezer for that! But if your fridge is freezing your food, it doesn't mean you need a new fridge. Usually, this issue can be easily diagnosed and repaired.If that does not solve your problem, then you'll need to replace that control. Shop Replacement Thermostat Controls > Damper Control Another reason why you may be experiencing freezing temperatures in your fresh food section could be related to the damper control. Most modern refrigerators use an auto damper to control how much air comes into the fresh food section from the freezer. Normally, about 20% will enter the fresh food section, but if the damper for some reason or another, sticks in an open position, you may have more air enter the fresh food and the temperature will drop dramatically. The damper control is typically located in the top section of a side-by-side, or the midsection on a top mount refrigerator. Your freezer temperature air enters from the freezer into the fresh food section. It will either be a flapper type door behind this grill or slide gate to regulate how much air comes into the fresh food. If you're experiencing freezing temperatures in your fresh food compartment, you would suspect that damper assembly should be closed if it's working properly. If it is wide open, that means it is defective or the sensor that controls the damper is defective. To diagnose and repair this issue, begin by making sure that there are no mechanical defects with it that are causing it to be jammed in an open position. Now, if you've determined that there does not appear to be any mechanical issues with your auto damper, the next thing we may suspect is the temp sensor that is associated with that. Most auto dampers will use some type of an electronic temp sensor to control the actual motor that drives the shutter or gate on that auto damper.",

Thermostat Control Damper Control Electronic Control Conclusion If your refrigerator is freezing food, then it's not doing its job – there's a freezer for that! But if your fridge is freezing your food, it doesn't mean you need a new fridge. Usually, this issue can be easily diagnosed and repaired.The temp sensor is typically located somewhere close to that airflow and will often have some type of a connector on the end of it that it can easily be plugged in. Some manufacturers use a hardwired type of temp sensor and it's simply a matter of cutting those leads and splicing in a new one if you need to replace it. To test a temp sensor, we, first of all, need the manufacturer's specifications for that particular sensor and they will indicate the resistance of that sensor at a specific temperature. Normally, they will show something for room temperature and give it a specific ohm reading. We simply need to take our multimeter, connect it to the leads or connector on that temp sensor, and then consult the chart to verify that the reading is what it is supposed to be. If you get a reading that is not consistent with the manufacturer's suggestions, you will need to replace that temp sensor. Shop Replacement Damper Controls > Electronic Control Another reason why your refrigerator may be freezing in the fresh food section could be related to the electronic control. Many modern refrigerators use electronics to control both the compressor, evaporator, and condenser fans in your refrigerator. Using sensors located throughout your refrigerator, that information is fed back to an electronic control to operate those devices. If the control interprets that data improperly, it may turn on the compressor and fans when they're not necessary. To troubleshoot whether the control is at fault, we, first of all, need to locate that control. On some models, this is located in the control housing at the front.",

Where is Your Samsung Dishwasher's Leak Sensor? How to Fix or Replace a Samsung Dishwasher Inlet Valve How to Clean or Replace a Samsung Dishwasher Fill Hose How to Replace a Samsung Dishwasher Float Switch If the 'Heavy' light on your Samsung dishwasher is blinking, it will mean one of two things depending on the model you have. In models that feature Express 60 capabilities, it means there's too much water in the dishwasher itself and you'll need to make sure the drain pump and drain hose are working properly. In models without the Express 60 feature, it means a leak has been detected by the leak sensor and the inlet valve, float switch, or fill hose will need to be inspected. Our guide will explain how to troubleshot this, to get your Samsung dishwasher working! Why Your Samsung Dishwasher Lights are Blinking The control panel on your Samsung dishwasher features a number of buttons for each cycle selection, and above those there are indicator lights. During the cycle, the indicator lights are letting you know what cycle is running and what features are selected. If no cycle is currently running, and you notice any of those indicator lights flashing or staying on, your Samsung dishwasher is trying to communicate an issue. Since there are no electronic displays to show you an error code, the appliance uses these lights to notify you what the problem is. It can be a single light, like this articles discusses, or a combination of up to four lights. Why is Your Samsung Dishwasher Not Draining? Seeing a 'Heavy' light blinking on Samsung dishwasher models with an 'Express 60' mode, without any other indications, tells us that there's too much water inside of the dishwasher, and this normally indicates an issue with its draining system.",

Where is Your Samsung Dishwasher's Leak Sensor?This means there's a part not working as well as it could be, or broken enough to stop working properly. If your dishwasher has an 'Express60' button or 'Quick+' button, this would apply to your model. How to Clean or Replace a Samsung Dishwasher Filter The first and simplest part you can fix is the filter in your Samsung dishwasher. The filter is designed to catch and trap any larger pieces of food debris from entering your dishwasher's drain and causing clogs or damage to the other more sensitive components. A clogged or damaged filter means water does not drain easily and food waste can more easily gain access to the drain system. This leads to further clogs and eventually too much water sitting in the dishwasher tub, which will raise the float switch and lead to a blinking 'Heavy' light. But we're here to explain exactly how to inspect your filter and either clean or replace it, so your dishwasher can properly drain. Open your dishwasher door and locate the filter, usually at the bottom of the tub's interior. Remove the lower dish rack, and if necessary, remove the lower spray arm to gain access to the filter. Remove the filter and, if necessary, clean it by soaking it in warm soap and water for 5 minutes, and then scrubbing it with a soft-bristle brush. Inspect the filter for any signs of damage, and if you notice any holes or other damage that would otherwise stop it from working properly, replace it with a new filter. Reinstall the dish rack and spray arm, then run a quick cycle on your dishwasher to monitor for the code or if water doesn't drain properly.",

How to Clean or Replace a Samsung Dishwasher Filter How to Fix or Replace a Samsung Dishwasher Drain Hose How to Clean or Replace a Samsung Dishwasher Drain Pump Why is Your Samsung Dishwasher Leaking? Where is Your Samsung Dishwasher's Leak Sensor?How to Fix or Replace a Samsung Dishwasher Drain Hose The next part you can troubleshoot if your dishwasher isn't draining properly, is its drain hose . The drain hose, as its name implies, is a plastic hose attached to your dishwasher's drain pump that allows dirty and food-debris-filled water to exit the dishwasher and be disposed of. If this drain hose is clogged or cracked, it will cause water to either build up inside the dishwasher because it can't exit, or cause water to leak in and around your dishwasher, This leads to the float switch detecting too much water, and a flashing 'Heavy' light. To explain how to find your drain hose and see if it's in need of a replacement, check out the guide below! Locate the drain hose either behind the dishwasher or below it, or by inspecting underneath your sink. Run a short cycle on your dishwasher and monitor the drain hose for any water flow stoppages. If you notice the water stopping and/or not flowing consistently, disconnect your dishwasher from the wall outlet after the cycle is over. If your drain hose is clogged, use a screwdriver or wrench to remove any clamps and gain access to the hose's connection point, and use paper towel or a tube brush to dislodge and remove the clog. If your drain hose is also connected to a garbage disposal system, ensure it's turned off before you open it and inspect its interior for any clogs. If you discover your drain hose is not clogged but is instead cracked or broken, it will need to be replaced. Once your dishwasher's drain hose has been cleaned or replaced, run a short cycle to see if it drains properly.",

Where is Your Samsung Dishwasher's Leak Sensor?How to Clean or Replace a Samsung Dishwasher Drain Pump The most time consuming part that you'll have to troubleshoot in your Samsung dishwasher if it's not draining properly, is its drain pump . The drain pump is what facilitates the draining of the dishwasher, and in some models can be the main motor for the filling and draining of all water. If the drain pump is clogged or bad, it will cause water not to drain and instead buildup inside the dishwasher tub, and lead to the float switch detecting too much water, and cause the 'Heavy' light to start blinking. Whether there's something lodged in the drain pump or if there's a broken seal, we've got the guide to explain to you precisely how to figure out what's going on in your dishwasher. Disconnect your dishwasher from the wall outlet and turn off its water supply. Use a screwdriver or drill to unthread and remove the kickplate at the bottom of the dishwasher. Carefully unthread the fill hose from the inlet valve, and disconnect the electrical junction box and drain hose. Pull the dishwasher out, and flip it on its back by pulling and pushing its top backwards or to the side. Tip: Keep a towel close by for any water spilling that may occur. Unthread and remove any plastic panels covering the bottom of the dishwasher, as well as the leak detector sensor wire. Remove the wire harness from the drain pump's terminals, and rotate the drain pump counter clockwise while pulling it towards you to remove it. Inspect the drain pump for any clogs or damage, and remove any pieces of debris that could be causing the pump not to drain.",

The leak sensor in your Samsung dishwasher will blink the 'Heavy' light as an indication of water underneath it, if it's a model that doesn't have an 'Express 60' or 'Quick+' mode. This can happen for a couple of reasons, and we're going to break down the reasons and parts that would cause you to see the 'Heavy' light blinking on your Samsung dishwasher. Where is Your Samsung Dishwasher's Leak Sensor? Most Samsung dishwashers have a leak sensor at the bottom of the appliance that will communicate with the control board when there is moisture detected. Accessing this leak sensor to troubleshoot your dishwasher isn't difficult, but it does require some tools and time set aside to disassemble the dishwasher itself. Lucky for you, we'll explain exactly where to find it and what to look for.",

Inspect around the leak sensor for any dried soap or moisture residue that could point to a specific part underneath your dishwasher that's leaking. You may notice dried soap or moisture near the drain hose or drain pump, and you can read the guides above for how to properly troubleshoot those parts. How to Fix or Replace a Samsung Dishwasher Inlet Valve If any sort of leak is occurring underneath your Samsung dishwasher, it will very likely have something to do with its inlet valve . When you turn your dishwasher on and start a cycle, the fill hose routes water from your home's water supply, to the inlet valve. Any issues with the inlet valve caused by electrical failure or a plugged screen will result in water underneath your dishwasher and a detection by the leak sensor, and a blinking 'Heavy' light. The easiest way to resolve this is by removing the inlet valve and checking for any issues with it, and either fixing or replacing it, which we'll explain how to do. Turn off your water supply and disconnect your dishwasher from the wall outlet.",

When this occurs, your dishwasher will shut off the water intake to prevent water damage to your home. With this guide, you'll learn how to systematically inspect these parts to clear the code. What Does the E15 Error Code Mean on a Bosch Dishwasher? Flashing ‘E15’ is your Bosch dishwasher’s way of telling you that it has detected water accumulating in the base pan underneath the appliance. This occurs during a leakage, as water travels down the dishwasher's double-wall hose and collects in the base pan. As water pools in the pan, it activates a safety switch, which then stops the water intake and displays the error code. This safety feature is called “AquaStop”, and it is designed to prevent water damage to your home. What Causes the E15 Error Code on a Bosch Dishwasher? Understanding the potential causes behind the E15 error is crucial for effective troubleshooting. Several factors can trigger this code, including: Leaky Seals or Gaskets: The door seal or gaskets seal the dishwasher tightly during operation. Over time, the door seal or gaskets around the dishwasher can wear out or become damaged, allowing water to escape into the base pan. Cracks or Damage to the Dishwasher Tub: Any physical damage to the inside of the dishwasher can lead to water leaking into the base pan.",

What Causes the E15 Error Code on a Bosch Dishwasher?How to Fix the E15 Error Code on a Bosch Dishwasher Clearing the E15 error involves two main steps: getting rid of any water in the dishwasher's base and then fixing the underlying cause of the leak.How to Inspect a Bosch Dishwasher Door Seal to Fix the E15 Error Code The door seal runs along the perimeter of the dishwasher door, creating a watertight barrier to prevent water from leaking out during wash cycles. Open the door fully to expose the entire seal and carefully examine it. Look for any signs of wear or areas where the seal might have come loose. If the seal is compromised, it must be replaced. Replacement seals can be installed with a bit of patience. To remove a damaged door seal: Start at one end and gently pull it away from its groove. Most seals are press-fitted and do not require tools for removal. Then, clean the groove or channel where the seal sits. Remove any residue, food particles, or buildup to ensure the area is clean and smooth for the new seal. Take the new seal and begin to press it into place, starting at one corner and working your way around the door. Make sure the seal is evenly seated in the groove without any twists or folds. How to Inspect a Bosch Dishwasher Water Inlet Valve to Fix the E15 Error Code The inlet valve opens at the beginning of each wash cycle to allow water to enter your dishwasher. It then closes to stop the flow once the correct level is reached. If this valve does not close completely, it can lead to excessive water entering the dishwasher, potentially resulting in leaks. To inspect the valve: Find the inlet valve at the bottom front section of your dishwasher, behind the lower kickplate or access panel. You’ll need to remove this panel with a screwdriver to reach the valve. Visually examine it for any signs of wear or corrosion.",

What is the TurboFreeze (tF) Mode on GE Refrigerators? What is the TurboCool (tC) Mode on GE Refrigerators? How Do the tF and tC Settings Work on GE Refrigerators? How to Use the tF and tC Settings on GE Refrigerators How to Use the tF Setting How to Use the tC Setting Considerations to Using the tF and tC Settings on GE Refrigerators General Electric (GE) refrigerators are known for their easy-to-use controls. Two features that often catch users' attention are the tF and tC codes. These aren't error messages but display codes for the TurboFreeze and TurboCool settings. The TurboFreeze setting on a GE refrigerator helps freeze items quickly, while the TurboCool setting rapidly cools down the fridge section. In this article, we'll explore how these codes work and give you tips for using them effectively. What Do the tF and tC Codes Mean on GE Refrigerators? The tF and tC codes on GE refrigerators are display codes for two special settings called TurboFreeze and TurboCool. When activated, these settings rapidly adjust the temperature in different compartments of the refrigerator to address particular cooling needs. But, many people think these codes mean something is wrong and try to fix them, even though they don't indicate any issues with the fridge. It's a common mistake that can cause confusion and unnecessary repairs. What is the TurboFreeze (tF) Mode on GE Refrigerators? TurboFreeze is a mode meant to quickly make the freezer colder. When you see the tF code, it means this feature is turned on. It's perfect for scenarios when you're opening the freezer door frequently or for extended periods, like when you're rearranging or cleaning it, hosting a large gathering, or need to rapidly cool down items, such as a bottle of wine or newly purchased groceries. The symbol for TurboFreeze might resemble 'EF,' an upside-down 'f' with an 'F,' or something similar. Just keep in mind that TurboFreeze won't make your ice maker work faster. What is the TurboCool (tC) Mode on GE Refrigerators?",
    "Title: What the tF and tC Codes Mean on GE Fridges. Subtitle: A step-by-step guide for GE Refrigerators. What Do the tF and tC Codes Mean on GE Refrigerators? What is the TurboFreeze (tF) Mode on GE Refrigerators? What is the TurboCool (tC) Mode on GE Refrigerators? How Do the tF and tC Settings Work on GE Refrigerators?This setting is for the refrigerator section, and when you see the tC code, it means this feature is active. It quickly lowers the temperature inside the fridge, which is handy when you've been opening the fridge door frequently, adding a lot of new food to the fridge (like after a big grocery shopping trip, storing a big batch of meals, or putting away warm leftovers). TurboCool is also helpful when your fridge experiences a power outage, as it helps bring the temperature back to normal quickly. You might spot a symbol like EC, an upside-down ‘f’ with a ‘C’ instead. How Do the tF and tC Settings Work on GE Refrigerators? The TurboFreeze and TurboCool settings on GE refrigerators focus on two main components: the compressor and the fans. When you turn on either of these settings, the compressor speeds up, and the fans start moving cold air more vigorously. This rapid action swiftly cools down the specific compartments: the tC setting targets the fresh food section, while the tF setting chills the freezer. As this happens, you'll see 'tF' or 'tC' on the display. You can even use these settings together at the same time for the most efficient cooling. How to Use the tF and tC Settings on GE Refrigerators How to Use the tF Setting To activate or deactivate TurboFreeze, press and hold the Freezer button for 3 seconds. On touch screen (LCD) models, select Express Mode instead. The TurboFreeze setting will run for 8 hours by default, but you can manually turn it off if needed. How to Use the tC Setting To turn on or off TurboCool, follow a similar process: press and hold the Fridge button for 3 seconds. For touch screen (LCD) models, use the Express Mode button.",

If you find that the tF or tC settings aren't working as expected, first, check for any power issues or control lock settings. If the temperature doesn't adjust properly, make sure there's no excessive frost buildup or blocked air vents. Regular maintenance is crucial to ensure these features work effectively, which includes cleaning the condenser coils and ensuring the door seals are intact. Considerations to Using the tF and tC Settings on GE Refrigerators Now that you understand how to use the tF and tC settings effectively, it's essential to understand some key considerations when using them. These will help you make the most of these features while ensuring your refrigerator runs efficiently and your food stays in excellent condition. Noise Level: These settings may make your refrigerator run a bit louder than usual because the compressor and fans work harder. If noise is a concern, especially during quiet times, consider using these settings when they are less disruptive. Duration of Settings: Remember to turn off the settings when they are no longer needed, as they use more energy. Energy Costs: Frequent use of tF and tC settings can lead to higher energy bills over time. Be mindful of your energy usage and use these features judicially to balance convenience and cost.

Not only is there a mess to clean up, but it also means that your dishwasher is going to need some maintenance. Or perhaps you’ve woken up in the morning to discover the cycle never finished and there’s an error code flashing on your dishwasher’s display. If you are seeing “F2” or two flashing lights from your Whirlpool dishwasher, it means that you have a leak. Unfortunately, this won’t tell you where the leak is coming from, you’ll have to open up the machine and inspect further for that. The information below will help you troubleshoot the source of your leak, show you how to replace any damaged parts, and get your dishwasher back in action. Please note that this information is related to correcting an F2 error code concerning a leak. Depending on your model, this error code will show up on your display as “F2” or you may see two flashing lights. Newer models of Whirlpool dishwashers have larger displays, and more detailed error codes. If your Whirlpool dishwasher is displaying “F2E1” or “F2E2” this is related to a User Interface issue, and not a leak. How to Prevent a Whirlpool Dishwasher F2 Error Code The first item you should check in your Whirlpool dishwasher is the filter. If you have not been regularly cleaning out the filter, food particles will begin to clog it up, and water will not drain from your machine properly. Keeping the filter clean will help keep other components of your dishwasher, like the drain pump, running more efficiently. If this task isn’t currently part of your cleaning routine, add it to your list at least once per month! If you scrape your dishes before loading, you can help prevent these clogs from happening.

Check that the machine is level from front to back, and from side to side, and make adjustments to the leveling legs if necessary. The final preventative maintenance item to avoid dishwasher leaks is to ensure that you’re using the proper detergent. Excess suds will lead to leaks, so it is important to use the correct quantity of detergent in your machine. Whirlpool recommends pods or tablets for their machines, but powder or liquid detergent will also work. If you have hard water, a powder detergent works well against mineral buildup, whereas soft water supplies may clean better with liquid or pods. Note that liquid dishwasher detergent is different from the dish soap you use in the sink – it is designed to not bubble and suds up. Using dish soap in your dishwasher will create way too many bubbles, and those bubbles will likely leak out of the machine all over your floor. Finding the Source of Your Whirlpool Dishwasher Leak If you are able to catch the leak in action, the location the water is coming from can give you some clues as to what is causing the leak. If the water is leaking out from around the door, it is likely an issue with the door gasket or seal, the spray arm, or the float. If the water is coming from underneath the machine, there is likely an issue with the drain pump, the hose or its connections, or the water inlet valve.

If the leak is coming from underneath the dishwasher, it is a good indicator that the pump may be the problem. The drain pump is normally found behind the access panel at the bottom of the dishwasher. How to Inspect a Drain Pump If the drain pump is clogged up with food debris, you can clean this out (along with the dishwasher’s filter) and your machine should drain normally again. If there are no visible clogs, you can use a multimeter to test if the pump is faulty. Set your multimeter to Rx1 and touch the terminals with the probes to test for continuity. If you get a reading of anything besides “zero” you will need a replacement drain pump . How to Replace a Drain Pump on a Whirlpool Dishwasher If you need to replace the pump on your dishwasher, this video will walk you through the steps of that repair. Door Gasket The door gasket on your dishwasher is used to create a watertight seal when the door is closed. The gaskets or door seals are typically made of rubber or vinyl, both of which can become brittle and crack over time and won’t create a proper seal, allowing water to leak out of the dishwasher. How to Inspect a Door Gasket First check that there isn’t food or debris stuck in the gasket. Crumbs can prevent the door from sealing properly, which may be causing your leak.

Water Inlet Valve The purpose of the water inlet valve is to connect your main water line to your dishwasher. If the leak is coming from underneath the machine and the drain pump wasn’t to blame, there may be an issue with the water inlet valve. A faulty valve may be letting too much water into your machine, causing a leak to happen. How to Inspect a Water Inlet Valve The water inlet valve can be found behind the access panel at the base of your dishwasher. First check to ensure that the water supply lines are connected properly. Next check the valve for any signs of cracks or other damage, or indications that the valve is leaking. If you notice any of these, you will need to get a replacement water inlet valve .

If it is cracked or warped, you will need a replacement spray arm . How to Replace a Spray Arm in a Whirlpool Dishwasher Depending on your dishwasher model, the lower spray arm may be threaded in place or simply just pull right out of the machine. Float and Float Switch The float and float switch work together to prevent your dishwasher from overfilling with water. Once the appropriate water level has been reached, the float trips the switch to signal the machine to stop filling. If either of these components are faulty, the dishwasher may continue to fill which would result in a leak. How to Inspect a Float Switch You will need to use a multimeter to inspect the float switch for continuity. Set the multimeter to Rx1 and touch the probes to the switch’s terminals. The reading should be either zero or infinity. With the probes still in contact, press the button on the switch – the reading should now be the opposite (zero to infinity, or infinity to zero). If you do not receive these readings, then it is faulty and you will need a new float switch . How to Replace a Float Switch in a Whirlpool Dishwasher If you need to replace the float switch in your dishwasher, you may find it easier to work on if the dishwasher is pulled out from underneath the cabinet. Hoses and Clamps The hose clamps are used to secure the drain and circulating hoses to the dishwasher’s pump.

The motor powers the fan's rotation, and if it’s not working, the fan can’t do its job. This can make your fridge warm and cause the SY EF error. How to Inspect the Evaporator Fan Motor on a Frigidaire Refrigerator You're already near the fan blades, so the motor is close by. Try spinning the fan with your hand. If it's hard to move, the motor might be the issue. Take off the blade and anything around the motor. Check the motor for any damage, like frayed wires or burn marks. How to Test and Replace the Evaporator Fan Motor on a Frigidaire Refrigerator Your fridge fan uses a 12-volt motor. To see if it's working, use a multimeter set to volts DC. Follow your fridge's manual to find the right terminals to test the fan motor. It should show 12 volts. If it's under 8 volts, the motor needs replacing. If you're switching out the motor, take any mounts from your old motor and attach them to the new one. Fit the new motor in place, making sure it's held firm with its bracket. Slide the fan blade back and reconnect the wiring. After that, reassemble everything in order. Explore our genuine OEM evaporator fan motors.",

It manages many tasks. If it can't communicate with parts like the fan, the SY EF error might show up because the fridge can't control temperatures properly. How to Inspect the Main Control Board on a Frigidaire Refrigerator If your fridge has doors side-by-side, open both of them. If your freezer is on top, pull out the drawer. Remove the lower grill or kick plate from the base of the fridge. Use a big, flat screwdriver to gently push down and pull the board's cover forward. Remember how the wires are connected. Taking a picture with your phone can help you remember. Once you know how the wires go, unplug them. Then, remove the plug from the test port. After that, you can take out the old board. How to Test and Replace the Main Control Board on a Frigidaire Refrigerator With your trusty multimeter, you can test the control board. Here’s a quick rundown of the wires on the board: Brown Wire: It's the common or ground wire. It ensures that electricity flows smoothly through the system and safely returns to the source, completing the circuit. Blue Wire: It tells the main board how fast the fan is spinning. If the fan's too fast or slow, the blue wire sends a signal to adjust it. Yellow Wire: It controls the fan's speed. The control board can adjust the voltage on this wire to make the fan spin faster or slower. Red Wire: It supplies a steady 12 VDC, making sure all parts of the fridge have the power they need to work right. A working board will show 12 to 14 VDC between the brown and red wires on your multimeter.",

Preventing Future SY/5Y EF Errors on a Frigidaire Refrigerator To avoid the SY EF message popping up again, here's what you should do: Maintain Proper Ventilation Your fridge needs room to breathe, just like you! Check where the vents are on your fridge. They could be between the freezer and fridge sections or at the back. Make sure they aren't blocked, so cold air flows easily. Inspect the Door Gaskets The doors have soft rubber seals called gaskets. They keep the cold in when the doors are shut. Look to see they're clean and not damaged. If warm air sneaks in, the fridge has to work more, and you might get frost inside. To remove a fridge door gasket, start at one corner and gently pull it away from its track, working your way around the door. If your new seal looks bent or twisted when you first take it out, soak it in warm water or use a hairdryer on a low setting to make it pliable. Once it's more flexible, install it in the door, making sure that it lies flat and seals well. Defrost the Freezer When Needed If you see a lot of ice building up in the freezer, it's time for a defrost. Too much ice blocks the air and makes the fan work harder. Check your user manual. Your fridge may have a special defrost setting, sometimes called “forced defrost”.",

Is your Frigidaire refrigerator showing error code, ‘H1’ and you’re lost for what it means? That’s okay, because you still have lots of time to fix the situation but if left for too long, your food will spoil. Frigidaire error code ‘HI’, commonly misinterpreted as ‘H1’, is a code that indicates a ‘high temperature’ within your refrigerator. Depending on the model of your refrigerator, you may hear an audible beeping noise when this error occurs, in addition to a visual code. This issue can be caused by a few parts, and can be fixed relatively easy, but depends completely on which part or issue is causing the higher than normal temperatures. What Is Frigidaire Refrigerator Code H1? Error code H1 appears with Frigidaire refrigerator models when the temperature exceeds 26°F or -3.3°C in the freezer, and 55°F or 12.8°C within the refrigerator. Considering refrigerators should ideally remain between 35-38°F or 1.6-3.3°C and freezers should be on or around 0°F/-18°C, that’s making quite the jump, and should absolutely be a warning sign of something not working properly within your appliance. To avoid spoiling your food, it’s best to first figure out whether your fridge, freezer, or both are being impacted by this high temperature issue. Try using a thermometer to test whether the internal temperature of both your freezer or refrigerator align with the set temperature setting.",

In all fairness, however, because of the digital displays within these Frigidaire refrigerators, ‘H1’ and ‘HI’ would read the exact same. In addition, because many of the fridges displaying these codes have two separate displays for the fridge and freezer, it actually carries a different meaning. If you see H1/HI blinking on the display for the freezer, but not the fridge, the high temperature issue lies solely within the freezer - and the same applies for the fridge. If you see H1/HI blinking on both the display for the freezer and refrigerator, this temperature issue applies to both. How To Troubleshoot Frigidaire Refrigerator Error Code H1 There are methods to not only finding out which part(s) is giving your refrigerator its H1 error, but there are also a few preliminary things you can do to potentially fix the H1/HI error outright.",

Although the issue is fairly simple to understand, its cause can be harder to grasp.Keep The Door Shut First, Frigidaire’s own website describes the main cause for an HI error to be, “...by inadvertently not closing the door all the way or leaving the door open for an extended period of time.” so making sure your fridge doors are closed and sealed when the fridge is not in use is an obvious first step. Eliminate Frost Build-Up Eliminating any frost buildup around the door seal and within the fridge and freezers themselves will improve air circulation and keep the temperature much lower. Frost buildup usually occurs when moisture is captured into the freezer and can’t escape, and this can be eliminated by removing unnecessary food items or rearranging the storage of the food containers to improve air circulation. Without proper air circulation and cooling within the appliance, bacteria can fester and grow quicker, which is why eliminating any frost is extremely important. The following video will give you a general idea of how to eliminate this frost buildup in your refrigerator. Troubleshoot Individual Parts Many Frigidaire fridges come with an included troubleshooting guide with instructions to test each part individually. This feature isn’t available in every model, but you can normally locate this troubleshooting guide behind a kick plate at the bottom of the fridge, taped together in a small bag. By doing this, you can find out which part(s) are not working properly and gain a better grasp on the situation at hand. However, if your model does not have a guide included, you can be rest assured that following our guide will help you find the solution to this issue!",

Although the issue is fairly simple to understand, its cause can be harder to grasp.How To Inspect Frigidaire Fridge Condenser Coils to Fix an H1 Error Condenser coils are a set of tubes at the bottom of the back of your refrigerator. Those tubes are responsible for removing any heat from the refrigerant - which is a liquid that moves throughout the fridge and freezer - to keep your food cold. Sometimes, if the defrost system isn’t working properly or if the condenser coils are dirty and need cleaning, it can lead to frost building up on them, which can lead to improper cooling and will result in an H1/HI error code. To prevent these coils from getting frost buildup, these are actions you can take to keep them working their best: Clean condenser coils regularly: Lightly use a vacuum with a brush attachment to clean any dirt, dust and debris off them. Check for leaks: If you notice any liquid leaks around them, contact a professional repair technician, since refrigerant is highly toxic. Check the defrost system: Use your user manual to find and inspect the defrost system; ice or frost on the coils, or an empty drain pan underneath your fridge are signs that it’s not working. How To Reset a Frigidaire Refrigerator to Solve H1 Error Resetting your Frigidaire fridge may not completely solve whatever issue you’re having, in this case H1/HI/High Temperature, but if you have removed any frost buildup and made sure everything is working properly and the error code is still there, resetting it can resolve the error.

If the error comes back in an audible or visual form, it means there’s still an issue that lies within your fridge that needs to be resolved. This can only be done by replacing whichever part(s) are not working properly or are broken. How To Replace a Fridge Door Seal to Fix an H1 Error The seal on your fridge door is integral to keeping the cool, climate-controlled environment of the fridge interior separate from the warmer room-temperature environment. Over time, through wear and tear, and incidental damage, fridge door seals can crack, grow mold or mildew, and become unserviceable. If the door seal stops working properly, the fridge will have a harder time cooling itself, leading to an H1 error code from the fridge. If this is the case for your fridge, you can order a new door seal from our wide range of Frigidaire door seals , and replace it by doing the following: Carefully pull the current door seal out of its groove. Clean the groove and edge of the door thoroughly - disinfectant spray or soap and water are recommended for this. Place the new door seal around the edge of the door and carefully work it into the groove. Test the seal by closing the door and inspecting for any bumps, ensuring it’s flush and completely sealed.

Although the issue is fairly simple to understand, its cause can be harder to grasp.The damper is controlled by the user’s control knob and when adjusted lower, it opens further to allow more cold air to flow into the fridge compartment. When the damper stops opening properly or is broken, it will cause temperatures to rise, leading to an H1/HI error, and will need to be replaced immediately. It’s worth inspecting the damper before replacing it, to see if there is a large frost buildup, and if there is, eliminating it to test whether that solves your H1/HI error. Replacing a fridge damper will require a replacement damper, which you can find in our variety of fridge parts , and can be removed and installed with the following guide: Unplug your fridge from the wall outlet. Locate the damper in the fridge - it’s usually located at the top of the freezer & fresh food compartments. Depending on your model, you may need to remove the food contents and containers within your fridge. Remove the screws that secure the damper with a Phillips-head screwdriver. Disconnect the wire harnesses securing the damper and remove it. You can test the damper with a multimeter to see whether it has failed or if another part is the culprit. If the damper is bad, you can now install it and its wire harnesses, then secure it with the appropriate screws.

When this valve malfunctions, either from a mechanical issue or an electrical failure, you’ll notice problems with your fridge’s water and ice functions. Are your ice cubes coming out smaller than usual? Has your ice maker stopped working? Is the water dispenser slow or not working at all? In this guide, we’ll cover everything you need to know about the refrigerator inlet valve, including how to find it, how to test it, and when and how to replace it. What is an inlet valve and how does it work? The water inlet valve on your refrigerator, also known as a solenoid valve, regulates the flow of water into the refrigerator for the ice maker and water dispenser. Understanding what a solenoid is and how it works is key to understanding how the inlet valve functions. Essentially a solenoid is an electrical coil that acts as a switch, when electricity flows through it the switch opens, and when there is no electricity, it closes. This valve is integral to controlling the flow of water, it operates much like a faucet, opening and closing valves, the only difference is that it is electronically controlled. When your fridge needs water to fill the ice cube tray, or to fill your cup with water, it signals to the valve that water is needed via an electrical current.",

How a refrigerator water inlet valve works: Where is the inlet valve?That signal is what energizes the solenoid that is in the valve. The signal is constant so as long as the signal is present and the valve is open and water is flowing. When the signal stops the valve closes and the flow of water into the appliance is cutoff. How a refrigerator water inlet valve works: This step-by-step breakdown walks you through how the water inlet valve controls the flow of water in your refrigerator. Every time you fill a glass with water, or the ice maker makes another batch the inlet valve is a vital part of the process. Learn how the inlet valve opens and closes, and how it knows when to do that. The process begins anytime you are pouring a glass of water from the water dispenser, or the ice maker needs to fill up the tray with water. When those switches are engaged or activated the control board knows water is needed, and sends signal to the inlet valve via electric current. The electrical current activates the solenoid and creates a magnetic field. The magnetic field pulls the plunger inside the valve to allow water to flow. When the fridge has enough water, the electric current is cut off and the solenoid is no longer magnetic. A spring helps push the plunger back into place, this closes the valve and stops the flow of water. Where is the inlet valve? Not all refrigerators have a water inlet valve. Your appliance will only have one if it includes an ice maker or a water dispenser. While the exact placement can vary by model, the inlet valve is usually located at the back of the refrigerator near the bottom, where the household water supply connects to the appliance.",

The signal is constant so as long as the signal is present and the valve is open and water is flowing. When the signal stops the valve closes and the flow of water into the appliance is cutoff.You won’t be able to see this part just by pulling your refrigerator away from the wall. To reach it, you’ll need to remove the lower rear access panel, which is typically a thin sheet of metal or cardboard held in place with screws. This panel protects important and valuable parts, helps reduce dust buildup, minimizes operational noise, and ensures proper ventilation and airflow. Once the access panel is removed, you’ll need to locate the inlet valve. Following the water supply line will usually lead you directly to it. The valve is typically secured to the refrigerator cabinet or frame with a metal bracket. The valve itself is made of plastic and is often blue, green, or white. How does the refrigerator inlet valve fail Due to the fact the inlet valve is an electromechanical device, it can fail in a couple of different ways. As outlined above, the electrical portion tells the valve when to open and close, and the mechanical portion handles the opening and closing of the parts within the valve. If your inlet valve is faulty, it may be due to either an electrical failure or a mechanical failure. Below, we’ll outline both. Mechanical failure of the inlet valve Mechanical failure is a physical problem with the part and how it functions. Parts within the inlet valve like screens, seals, diaphragms, can get clogged with dirt, debris, and mineral build up. Over time these parts can also deteriorate, wear out, or crack. If any one of these individual parts cannot do its job, the valve will not function properly.",

The signal is constant so as long as the signal is present and the valve is open and water is flowing. When the signal stops the valve closes and the flow of water into the appliance is cutoff.Here are the most common mechanical failures the water inlet valve can experience: Dirt, debris, or buildup causing the valve to become stuck in the open or closed position. Cracks or damage to the parts, which can cause leaks and reduce water pressure. Worn or failing seals and diaphragms. Clogged screens that can no longer filter properly, restricting water flow. Blockages from internal buildup inside the valve, reducing water flow or preventing the valve from moving. Mechanical issues can affect your refrigerator’s ability to fill with water, and they don’t always present as a single problem. You might notice that it fills slowly, doesn’t fill at all, or overfills due to poor regulation. Any time the water levels for these features are off, it’s a sign that the flow of water is not being properly controlled, and the inlet valve could be the cause. Electronic failure of the inlet valve The water inlet valve is controlled by a solenoid, when it is active the valve is open, and it releases water from the supply line into the refrigerator. If a solenoid no longer has continuity, it will no longer be able to do its job, and the mechanical parts within the valve will not be engaged. It is not uncommon for a solenoid to fail or wear out over time. Some common electrical issues are: One or more solenoid coils in the valve have burnt out. There is a shorted coil within the valve. A broken or damaged wire in the solenoid coil. Any corrosion or damage to the terminals on the valve. Signs your refrigerator inlet valve is faulty If the inlet valve on your refrigerator is failing that will manifest itself as issues with your ice maker and water dispenser.",

The failure of this part might not be sudden, in the lead up to failure you might notice these features only working intermittently and it could be a sign the part is beginning to fail. Any time you notice performance issues with your ice maker or water dispenser it could be a sign that there are issues with the inlet valve. Ice maker issues you might notice: No ice being produced. Ice cubes are smaller than normal. Hollow or irregularly shaped ice cubes. Overfilling of the icemaker, leading to ice cubes to freeze together, or creating ice at the bottom of the freezer. Water dispenser issues you might notice: No water being dispensed and no sound coming from the dispenser, which may indicate a faulty solenoid valve. No water being dispensed but a clicking or humming sound is heard, meaning the signal is reaching the valve but it is failing to open and allow water through. Weak or low water flow from the dispenser, even when the water filter is clear and not causing the issue. Water dispenser dripping water when not engaged. If your dispenser is dripping you will notice water pooling in the drip tray or running down the fridge door. This happens when the valve does not close completely due to wear over time or debris that is preventing the plunger from sealing completely. Finally, a failing inlet valve can lead to water leaking from your fridge, often it is localized to the area around the valve itself. Which means if there is a leak behind your refrigerator it is very likely the inlet valve is the source.",

Before you pull out your refrigerator and get to work you might want to do a few small checks to rule out any other explanations for these problems. If your ice maker is not making any ice at all, before you jump to any conclusions about the water supply and the inlet valve, you should check the bail arm on your ice maker. If it is stuck in the engaged position the ice maker will not make ice, as it thinks the ice bin is full of ice and no additional ice is needed. This simple check could save you a lot of trouble. If the issue you are having is related to the flow of water from the dispenser, if it is slow and lacks pressure you should first rule out any issues with the water filter. If it is clogged, or if it has not been replaced in a long time, that could be the reason there is restricted flow of water in your refrigerator.",

How a refrigerator water inlet valve works: Where is the inlet valve?That signal is what energizes the solenoid that is in the valve. The signal is constant so as long as the signal is present and the valve is open and water is flowing. When the signal stops the valve closes and the flow of water into the appliance is cutoff.Step One: Testing the water supply The first step in the troubleshooting process will be to test the water supply, to make sure that the pressure and flow of water from your house to your refrigerator is sufficient. If it is not, the problem lies in the water supply rather than the inlet valve. Turn off your refrigerator. The time spent doing the inspection is not too long, so if you leave the door closed the appliance will maintain the temperature and your food will be safe. Locate the water supply line that runs to your refrigerator and shut off the supply. Place a towel on the floor below where the water line enters the fridge, just in case any water spills out. Most models you should be able to remove the water supply line without removing the access panel on the lower portion of your refrigerator. Disconnect the water supply line from the inlet valve and point the supply line into a bucket. Turn the water supply on briefly to check and evaluate the flow. If the flow of water is normal and consistent you can rule out issues with the water supply, and you will need to keep investigating issues with the inlet valve. If the flow of water from the water supply line is weak, or there is no water at all, the issue is the with water supply to the refrigerator not the inlet valve. Turn the water supply off again before moving on. Once you have ruled out water supply issues and have turned the water supply off, it is time to move on to the next steps of the investigation. At this point, you know there could be a problem with the inlet valve, and you will need to access and inspect the part.",

When the signal stops the valve closes and the flow of water into the appliance is cutoff.Step Two: Visual inspection of the inlet valve The next step in the testing process involves removing the inlet valve from your refrigerator. Follow these step-by-step instructions to get that done: You will now need to remove the inlet valve for inspection and that starts with removing the lower access panel on your refrigerator. It should be as simple as removing the screws holding it in place. In the previous step you will have removed the water supply line for the external water supply, you now need to remove any fill tubes which are attached to the outlets on the valve and supply the ice maker and water dispenser. If there is more than one outlet tube you should label them so you can properly reattach them later in the process. How you remove the tubes depends on the type of connection to the valve. There are two main types. If the valve has quick connects, press in on the collar while pulling the tube out. If it uses a fitting, loosen the plastic nut before pulling the tube out. The valve has electrical connections, so the solenoid can function, the number of connections depends on the valve. For instance, single solenoid valves often have two wires connected to the terminals, while double solenoids have four. Before removing the wires, you should take a picture of the connections to make reinstalling the valve easier. When you remove the connections do not pull on the wires, as this can cause damage, you want to pull on the metal connector. We recommend using needle nose pliers to grasp the connector and gently pull to remove it. You now need to remove any screws or nuts holding the valve in place on the mounting bracket.",

The signal is constant so as long as the signal is present and the valve is open and water is flowing. When the signal stops the valve closes and the flow of water into the appliance is cutoff.There are usually one or two depending on the size and placement of the valve. You can now remove the valve from the refrigerator. Once you have removed the inlet valve from the refrigerator you will want to visually inspect the part for any issues. Here are some of the things you will be looking for: Cracks to the casing of the valve that might result in leaks. Mineral buildup or dirt clogging the filter screen. Any worn out or damaged seals, diaphragms, or fittings. Corrosion, discoloration, or damage on the electrical terminals. If you have made it this far and still have found no obvious faults or issues with the inlet valve you will want to test the valve for continuity. Step Three: Testing the valve for continuity To test for continuity, you will need to set your multimeter to the R X 1 ohms setting. If your multimeter is analog, you will need to pinch the probes together and adjust the needle to 0. Touch the probes of the multimeter to the terminals on the inlet valve and check reading. Some multimeters will make a sound to indicate if there is continuity. The exact values you are looking for could be printed on the side of the valve, or in the owner's manual, but a good rule of thumb is that for a working solenoid the reading should be between 500 and 1,500 ohms. If you get no reading, also known as infinite resistance, that means the solenoid is burnt out and the valve is faulty. If you get a very low reading of less than 100 ohms the solenoid coil has been shorted, and your valve needs to be replaced. If you get a reading in the 200-500 ohms range it is more of a grey area, this may be an acceptable range for some specific models, but it is rare.",

The signal is constant so as long as the signal is present and the valve is open and water is flowing. When the signal stops the valve closes and the flow of water into the appliance is cutoff.You will need to test each solenoid, so repeat this process for any solenoid on the valve. You can tell how many solenoids are present by counting the sets of metal prongs, the electrical terminals, since each set corresponds to a solenoid that needs to be tested. If any of the solenoids fail this test, the valve will need to be replaced. If a solenoid fails the continuity test, it confirms an electrical fault, and the inlet valve will need to be replaced. If all solenoids test within the proper range, then the inlet valve is not the source of the problem. When and how to replace a refrigerator inlet valve With any electrical faults it is obvious the valve would need to be replaced, but it is also our recommendation that the same is true for mechanical faults. Trying to clean and replace the internal parts of the valve is not a long-term reliable solution and comes with increased risk of failure. Your water inlet valve should be replaced if you have done the above troubleshooting and you have found: That the water supply is good, but there is no water flowing in the appliance. That the solenoid has no continuity or underperformed in the continuity test. If your valve does not open even when you know it is receiving voltage. If you found any visible damage to the valve itself, the screen, the seals, etc. If you have already done the hard work of removing this part for testing, there is no reason you cannot do the replacement yourself. It is simple and you'll save significantly on the price of hiring a repair person. You simply need to use the model number on your refrigerator to find the refrigerator inlet valve designed to fit your model.",

How to replace a refrigerator inlet valve: Pull out refrigerator, unplug the appliance, turn off water supply and disconnect the water supply line from the refrigerator. To avoid any mess, it can help to have a bucket to place the end of the water supply line in. Remove the lower access panel by removing the screws. Snap a picture of the fill tubes and electrical connections to make installing the new inlet valve easier. Before removing anything, place a towel on the floor underneath the valve, this will help collect any water that comes out of the valve or fill tubes as you remove them. Remove the fill valves, either by pressing the collar and pulling the tube out, or loosening plastic retaining nut and pulling the tube out. Disconnect the electrical connections from the terminals of the valve. Do not pull on the wires, use needle nose pliers to grasp the metal connectors and gently pull. Remove screws or nuts holding the valve to the mounting bracket and lift the valve out of the refrigerator. Place the new inlet valve on the bracket in the same position you found the old one you just removed. Secure it to the bracket but reattach the screws. Using the photo you took, connect the wires to the terminals on your new inlet valve. Attach the fill tubes to the valve, again this will either be via quick connect functionality or with a plastic retaining nut. Make sure the tubes are snug and securely attached to the valve to avoid any leaks.",

When the signal stops the valve closes and the flow of water into the appliance is cutoff.The water supply line should be attached to the new valve at this time, and once it is secure you should turn the water supply on to ensure there are no leaks from any of the connections. You would want to address that now before putting everything else back in place. You should check the functionality before reinstalling the access panel. To do so you will want to plug in the refrigerator and push it in far enough to access the water dispenser. When you are working on the inlet valve it allows air to enter the water supply lines in your fridge, to purge the air out you will need to fill 2 to 3 glasses of water. This also ensures proper water flow from the dispenser before moving onto next steps. If it is working as expected, and you are able to fill up those glasses of water, you have successfully installed the new inlet valve. To complete the job, reattach the lower access panel with the screws you removed earlier, use the towel to wipe up any water that may have spilled, push the fridge back into place, and enjoy a job well done! Without a properly working inlet valve, your refrigerator cannot provide the ice and water you rely on. Once the problem is confirmed and the valve is replaced, your fridge will return to normal operation with steady water flow, consistent ice production, and fewer worries about leaks. It may be a small component, but it plays a big role in keeping your refrigerator dependable and convenient every day.",

How do I dispose of my old dishwasher?Here, we've answered the most common ones to help you get ready for the next steps, where we'll show you exactly how to do it. Can I remove my dishwasher by myself? Yes, you can!Step 2: Turn Off the Water Supply You'll need to stop the water flow to your dishwasher. Find the water shutoff valve connected to your dishwasher's water line—this is usually located under your sink. Gently turn the knob clockwise until it stops. Be careful not to overtighten it, as it could break. Step 3: Disconnect the Water Supply Hose Find the water supply hose that connects your dishwasher to the shutoff valve, usually located under the sink. Check the hose for leaks or rust. If it looks worn out, you'll want to change it to a replacement hose later when you're reinstalling the dishwasher. Get an adjustable wrench to unscrew the water line. Keep a bucket and some towels ready just in case water drips out. Then, with pliers, gently pull off the dishwasher's drain hose and put the end into the bucket to avoid water leaking out onto the floor. Step 4: Disconnect the Drain Hose The next hose to disconnect is the drain hose, which links your dishwasher to either the sink or a garbage disposal unit, often through an air gap. Find the hose, loosen the clamp that holds it in place, and disconnect it. Once disconnected, aim the end of the hose into the bucket. Step 5: Remove the Mounting Brackets Your dishwasher is kept in place by some brackets that connect it to the bottom of your countertop. This stops it from shaking or moving when it's running. Just open the dishwasher door to find these brackets and unscrew them from the countertop. You can either leave the brackets attached to the dishwasher or remove them completely. Step 6: Lower the Legs Before you can move your dishwasher, you will need to lower it by unscrewing the legs.",

Can I remove my dishwasher by myself? Yes, you can!Depending on the make and model of your dishwasher, you will either have legs that can be lowered straight away, or you’ll need to access them by removing a faceplate. The faceplate can usually be removed by unclipping it or unthreading its mounting screws. When you have access to the legs, lower them down by twisting them clockwise until they are as low as you can get them. This will create a gap between it and the countertop, making it easier to pull out. Step 7: Slide Out the Dishwasher Gently pull the dishwasher away from its cavity. It’s great if someone can help you out here to make sure you don't drop it or pull too hard. Remember, there are water and power lines still attached, so be careful. Using furniture sliders or a dolly can also help with this step. Lift the dishwasher slightly as you pull it to avoid scratching your floor. Step 8: Final Disconnections With the dishwasher partway out, you’ll find it easier to see and reach any remaining hoses or wires. Disconnect these carefully, making sure your dishwasher is entirely free and ready to be moved completely. With the dishwasher out of the way, what's next? Depending on its condition, consider repairing, selling, donating, recycling, or responsibly disposing of it. Don't forget to prepare the space for any new installations.

With the new gasket in hand, carefully push it into place around the perimeter of the dishwasher door frame. Now run a quick washing cycle and monitor for any leaks. How to Replace a Clogged Filter in a GE Dishwasher The filter in your dishwasher, like any other appliance, is there to collect food debris that would otherwise cause issues later on in the draining process. Water sitting at the bottom of your dishwasher after it's finished its washing cycle is a good indication that the filter is clogged, and that could become a leak if not cleaned or replaced. But if you've never changed your GE dishwasher filter and you're now noticing a leak at the bottom or front of it, there's an even greater chance that the filter is causing the leak. Lucky for you, a filter is an incredibly easy part to replace (or clean), and we'll show you precisely how to do it. Turn off the power to your dishwasher. Open your dishwasher door and locate the filter housing at the bottom of the cabinet. Remove the lower spray arm. Twist to remove the old filter. If there's a securing latch, you may need to disengage it before you can remove the filter. Clean the current filter by soaking it for a few minutes, and then washing it by hand with soap.

A broken or shorted water inlet valve will cause leaks in your dishwasher, because it has limited or no control over the flow of water entering it. And since inlet valves are normally located near the bottom of the appliance, it's safe to say that it would be the cause if there's a substantial amount of water around the valve, or underneath near the rear when your dishwasher's off. An easy way to test if the inlet valve is bad, is by opening the door of the dishwasher while it's running – if the water is running, the valve is defective. If your GE dishwasher's inlet valve needs to be replaced, this step-by-step guide will show you exactly how to do that. First, turn off the power and water to the dishwasher, and ensure there is no water on the floor near your appliance. Unthread and disconnect any screws securing the kick plate at the bottom of your dishwasher. Locate the water inlet valve and disconnect the water supply line from it. This may require a wrench to do. De-clamp the drain and fill hose underneath your sink, then unthread any securing screws to the dishwasher. Unthread and disconnect the wires in the junction box before continuing, if necessary. Pull your dishwasher into an open area and rotate it onto its back. Inspect the valve for any signs of damage, breaks or leaks.",

Unscrew and disconnect the valve and its wire harness to remove it. Install the new inlet valve by securing it with screws and connecting the wire harness. Rotate the dishwasher back upright and push it back into place. Connect the water supply line to the valve, and clamp the hoses back into place. If the junction box was disconnected previously, reconnect all of the wires. Plug your dishwasher back in and run short washing cycles and monitor it for leaks. How to Replace the Float and Float Switch in a GE Dishwasher The float and float switch, also known as a flood switch, in a GE dishwasher are necessary for detecting and managing the level of water inside the dishwasher during the washing cycle by turning the drain pump on and off. The float will rise and lower depending on the level of water in the dishwasher, but if it gets stuck in either the 'on' or 'off' position (up or down), the pump will either stay on indefinitely or not turn on at all – which is where a leak would arise. So if your GE dishwasher float switch is defective or broken, and you've got a leak underneath your dishwasher, not only do we have the parts you need, we'll tell you how to replace it, too! First, disconnect power to the dishwasher by unplugging it from the wall outlet, turn off the water supply, and remove the racks within the interior of the dishwasher. Remove the lower spray arm. Remove any filters from the bottom of the dishwasher to gain access to the float switch.",

Once the float switch is accessible, carefully pull it out and disconnect any wires attached to it. Now, you can completely remove the float switch and test it with a multimeter if you'd like. To install the new float switch, connect the wire harness to it and install it within the dishwasher. Reconnect any panels necessary and secure them properly. Reseat the filters and the spray arms, as well as replacing the racks within the dishwasher. Run a quick cycle within the dishwasher and monitor for any leaks. How to Change a Pump in a GE Dishwasher The pump in any dishwasher is simply used to circulate and drain water during its washing cycle, and without it working properly or if it's damaged, it will cause excessive water to build up and/or simply leak. An easy way to detect if your drain pump is out of commission is to see if it actually runs during the drain cycle. If it simply hums quietly when it should be draining, it needs to be replaced. However, if it runs and you're still noticing water left in the dishwasher after the cycle is over, your issue likely lies with the drain hose. So if you're finding water underneath your dishwasher, we have a wide-range of GE dishwasher pumps for you to choose from, and a replacement guide to assist you in replacing it! Unplug and disconnect your dishwasher's power, and turn off and disconnect the water supply. Open your dishwasher's door and remove all of the interior contents, including spray arms and filters.

Disconnect all wires and sensors connected to it, then loosen and remove the drain hose. If your model has pump latches, disconnect them. Remove the pump assembly from underneath or through the inside of the cabinet. Now, carefully remove the drain pump motor. Install the new drain pump, and any seals or clamps necessary. Use a small amount of dish soap to lubricate the sump seal, and set it into the dishwasher. Rotate the dishwasher onto its back and secure the sump assembly. Reconnect the drain hose, as well as all wires and sensors to the assembly. Push your dishwasher back into place, and reconnect any wires. Reconnect the water line, kick plate, filter, spray arm and dish racks to the dishwasher. Run a quick cycle and monitor for leaks.

They strike a nice balance between security and convenience, but be careful not to forget the code. They might also cost a bit more than simple padlocks. Strap or Latch Locks: Made with a flexible strap or latch and strong adhesive, these locks are designed to be unobtrusive and child-friendly. They're generally easier to install and use but might not provide as much security against determined efforts to open them. They're great for keeping little ones out, but might not be as effective against adults or older kids. The adhesive also wears out over time.

Don't worry, we're here to guide you on what needs fixing and how to do it! Check Your Wall Outlet It's important to make sure the wall outlet that's delivering power to your GE dishwasher is compatible and safe.

Step One: Remove the Food Step Two: Defrost the Freezer Step Three: Clean the Main Compartment Step Four: Clean the Lid Liner and Gasket Step Five: Clean the Freezer Exterior Step Six: Clean the Freezer Grill Step Seven: Turn the Freezer Back On Did you know that frost and ice buildup can affect the efficiency of your freezer? If your freezer isn’t running efficiently, it can lead to fluctuations in temperature, which in turn can lead to damaged or spoiled food. Having a properly cleaned and maintained chest freezer is the best way to ensure the quality of your food isn’t negatively impacted. Step One: Remove the Food The first step is to remove all the food from the freezer. The food should be kept in iceboxes or coolers so that it stays cold. If you don’t have access to those, cardboard boxes will also work, but you may want to wrap them in some blankets for extra insulation. When removing items from the freezer, inspect them for signs of damage like freezer burn. Typically, there will be a layer of frost or ice crystals on the surface if the food has freezer burn. Another sign is if the food looks dried out or shriveled up. Freezer burned food is still safe to eat, but it won’t taste the same - the flavor, texture, and color will all likely have changed for the worse. To prevent future freezer burn, make sure you are properly wrapping and storing your food in the freezer. Use designated containers, bags, or wraps, and ensure that any air has been removed from the packaging. A vacuum sealer can be a great choice if you regularly freeze a large quantity of food. Step Two: Defrost the Freezer Once the freezer has been emptied, it can be defrosted. If there is a large buildup of frost on the interior liner, you may be tempted to use a heat gun or a putty knife to scrape it off. We do not recommend you use these tools – just let it melt on its own! A hairdryer set to a low heat setting may be used to help speed up the process. A heat gun is much too powerful and will damage the interior lining of your freezer, whether it is plastic or metal.",

When any ice or frost has melted, remove the plugs and drain the water from the freezer. Step Three: Clean the Main Compartment To clean the interior of the freezer, simply use dish detergent and warm water with a soft scrub brush or washcloth. Start with the top area of the freezer opening, then the interior walls, and finish at the bottom. Once it is thoroughly scrubbed, it should be rinsed well with freshwater, in the same top to bottom order. Unless the food has leaked inside the freezer, this step shouldn’t require much elbow grease. Step Four: Clean the Lid Liner and Gasket Next, we’ll turn our attention to the lid liner and the gasket. Carefully inspect the gasket for any signs of deformity or damage and replace it if necessary. This will ensure your freezer door keeps a tight seal. Then look over the lid liner for any cracks, repairing or replacing if necessary. Once the lid has been inspected, it can be cleaned up. The same soap and water mixture, or a spray-on cleaner can be used here along with a soft cloth or sponge. Step Five: Clean the Freezer Exterior The exterior surface of the freezer can be cleaned with the dish detergent and water solution, or with a spray-on cleaner that is safe to use on painted surfaces. Give it a good wipe down and leave it to dry. Step Six: Clean the Freezer Grill On chest style freezers, there is likely a grill on the side of the freezer located next to the compressor. Give it a look over to make sure there is no debris or lint buildup.",

A bad smell in a refrigerator is almost always caused by food that is past its prime, or spills that were never dealt with. The very first step should be to remove all the spoiled food items from your refrigerator. Now before we get into how to clean your refrigerator, we are going to go over how a refrigerator works, as this will help in getting rid of those gross smells. How Your Refrigerator Works Whether you have a side-by-side model, bottom freezer or top freezer, all refrigerator styles circulate air from the freezer through the fresh food compartment and back into the freezer continuously as long as the refrigerator is running. This means that any odors that occur in the refrigerator typically get distributed in both the freezer and the fresh food compartments. The plastic lining of your refrigerator can absorb those smells if they are severe enough. Steps for Cleaning Your Smelly Refrigerator Gather The Materials Needed to Clean the Smell: Mild soap Soft sponge White vinegar Lemon juice (optional) Odor absorbent (baking soda, coffee grounds, activated charcoal) Small plate Give the Interior of Your Refrigerator a Thorough Cleaning Once you’ve removed the spoiled items from your refrigerator, the next step is to do a thorough cleaning. To begin the cleaning process, start by removing all of the shelves, and clean those individually with warm soapy water, rinse, and then let them completely dry.",

The plastic liner of the refrigerator and the doors can absorb some of those smells so they will also need a good deep scrub. You can use a warm soapy water and a soft sponge or rag. Be sure to get into all the little cracks and crevices. All shelves , bins, door gaskets, and handles in your refrigerator are parts that can easily be replaced if they are beyond the state of cleaning, and can give your appliance a \"like new\" look. Rinse Your Refrigerator Now that the interior part of the fridge is clean it will need to get a good rinse. You can just use water, but we recommend using water with a bit of cleaning vinegar or white vinegar mixed with it, about a ten to one water to vinegar ratio. You can also add a few drops of lemon juice to give it a nice refreshing smell. Once everything has been washed and rinsed completely, allow it dry before reassembling the shelves back in. Add an Odor Absorbent To get rid of any of that lingering odor, one of the best and most simple solutions is to use baking soda. Simply sprinkle some on a small plate and let that sit somewhere in the direct airflow inside the refrigerator. Fresh coffee grounds work much the same way, simply place them on a plate and set them somewhere in the direct airflow inside the refrigerator on a shelf. Alternatively, you may choose to use some activated charcoal, which can be found in local hardware stores or grocery stores. What to do if the Smell in Your Refrigerator Will Not go Away If after a few days you have not noticed the smell disappear, the problem may be a little deeper.",

We also suggest checking your air filter , as some models come equipped with one built right into your appliance. Generally, these need to be replaced every 6 months, so you may be in need of a replacement. How to Keep Your Refrigerator Smelling Fresh There are a few simple things you can do to ensure your refrigerator continues to smell fresh: Keep your refrigerator at the ideal temperature of 40 degrees Fahrenheit. This will reduce food spoilage and prevent the growth of bacteria. Use airtight containers when packaging up leftovers. Mark the date on the leftovers and throw-out if not consumed in a few days. Never over-pack your refrigerator because this can impede on proper air flow inside the appliance. Do a weekly check of food items and throw out anything past-due on a regular basis. Keep the refrigerator air filter up-to-date if your refrigerator model uses an air filtering system. How to Clean a Stainless Steel Refrigerator Now that the inner part of your refrigerator is sparkly clean and smelling fresh, it is time to tackle the outside. Stainless steel refrigerators are a super trendy look these days, and we do not think that trend is going anywhere, any time soon. They require very specific maintenance to ensure you don’t damage the stainless-steel finish. What to Avoid When Cleaning Stainless Steel: Avoid materials that may scratch the surface, such as sponges with a rough side or scotch pads. We suggest a microfiber cloth if possible. Avoid cleaning in a circular motion.",

Make sure you clean with the grain. Never use chlorine bleach on stainless steel. This chemical will cause a reaction with the stainless steel material, causing rust. Avoid anything that has a sticky substance, such as post-it notes or tape. If a mark has formed because a sticker has been left for too long, try using a mixture of soap and water or a product specific to removing adhesive film. Never use paper towel. They are often too coarse and can scratch the surface. Now it’s time to give it a good thorough clean with a mild soap and water solution. Once it has been cleaned thoroughly, you will want to give it a good rinse with just pure water to get rid of any soap residue. Next, use a stainless-steel polish over the entire surface, working with the grain. We hope these cleaning tips helped you solve your smelly fridge and left the outside shining like new!

    "Title: How to Clean Your Refrigerator Condenser Coils. Subtitle: Keep Your Refrigerator Running Efficiently. What Does a Condenser Do? Symptoms of Clogged Condenser Coils Where are Condenser Coils Located? How to Clean Condenser Coils Fan-Cooled Jelly-Roll Static Coils Fan-Cooled Open Coils The refrigerator is one of the hardest working appliances in your home and arguably the most important. Unfortunately, the condenser is prone dirt, dust, and pet hair build-up, and will need to be cleaned at least 1-2 times a year, ensuring your refrigerator keeps running as efficiently as possible. What Does a Condenser Do? The purpose of the condenser is to get rid of the excess heat that is located in this sealed system. The fan draws air through that condenser to keep it cool. It is important to have a back panel on any fan-cooled condenser to direct the air flow through that coil. Symptoms of Clogged Condenser Coils The dirt that accumulates on the refrigerators coils causes the condenser to preserve heat, rather then dispersing it, like it is meant to. This causes the compressor to have to work harder to overcompensate for what it senses as having too much heat. The compressor is the engine that runs the cooling process and is a very costly piece of equipment to replace. You might notice that it is running for longer periods of time, which is a good indication the coils are due for a cleaning. You might also notice a big jump in your utility bill. Where are Condenser Coils Located? The condenser coil can be found in a few different locations of a refrigerator depending on the model. Common locations include: the back of the unit, beneath the unit (these can be tricky to clean), and behind the front grille. To reduce the risk of electric shock, always unplug your appliance from the power before starting any maintenance or cleaning. How to Clean Condenser Coils Fan-Cooled Jelly-Roll The jelly roll style condenser has tubing that is encased with a steel plate to help dissipate the heat. If upon inspection you have determined there is substantial build-up and it needs a cleaning, we suggest using a condenser cleaning brush .",

Bottom Rack Cutlery Basket Upper Rack Bonus Tips Properly vs. Improperly Loaded Dishwasher: How Much Difference Does It Make? A properly loaded dishwasher will clean your dishes more effectively and eliminate the need to wash any items by hand. But did you know that many people will go their whole lives without ever knowing the proper rules and methods for effectively loading their dishwasher for best results? Not only can improper loading cause issues with getting your dishes properly cleaned, it can also cause damage to your machine and the dishes you load. In our experience, many people who report a broken or malfunctioning dishwasher are often just not using their dishwasher correctly, leading to negative symptoms. With our tips and tricks, you’ll learn how to make sure your dishes come out clean and shiny every time which can save you time AND money! While all dishwashers are basically the same, some manufacturers have different advice for how to load the racks. Make sure to first consult the user manual or owner's guide for your model and follow their instructions. Bottom Rack With most dishwashers, the larger items go on the lower rack. These items include plates, large bowls, cutting boards, casserole dishes etc. The key to making sure everything gets cleaned properly is to make sure there is enough space between the items so that water can freely circulate. You also need to make sure that items don’t protrude below the wire rack as they could interfere with your sprayer or become damaged. Try not to put plastic items on the bottom rack. Plastic items are more sensitive to the heat from the heating element and could melt. Make sure to check the edges of your dishes, if any are chipped or have sharp edges, be careful when putting them on the rack so you don’t cause damage to your rack, which could lead to a rust problem. Cutlery Basket Place items that are prone to nesting together – such as spoons – in different areas. You can also alternate your utensils handle down and handle up to keep them from nesting.",

Bottom Rack Cutlery Basket Upper Rack Bonus Tips Properly vs. Improperly Loaded Dishwasher: How Much Difference Does It Make? A properly loaded dishwasher will clean your dishes more effectively and eliminate the need to wash any items by hand.If items like these stick together, they may not get cleaned on the front side of one or the backside of the other. If you have sharp items such as knives or forks, avoid dropping them into your cutlery basket. Doing so could potentially damage the bottom of your basket and the sharp items could go down through the bottom of your basket and interfere with the bottom spray arm. Upper Rack Load glassware, smaller bowls and cutlery that may not fit properly on the bottom rack – such as large, sharp knives - onto the upper rack. You also may find that plastic bowls that don’t fit well on the bottom rack, will fit nicely on the upper rack. Keep in mind that if you place a large item over other items, the large item may not get a good wash. Most upper racks are designed to let bowls fit down through the center. Typically, you’ll see the tines pointed in one direction towards the back of the dishwasher and the opposite direction towards the front – this lets you place bowls facing toward the center. When loading multiple bowls, make sure they have enough space between them to ensure they all get a good cleaning. The rest of the rack is designed to handle mugs and glasses. Try to avoid placing glassware or mugs over the tines. If items rest or sit on tines, the tines may leave a stain on the bottom of your dish. Most racks will have something designed for long stemware to keep items such as wine glasses from wobbling around and breaking. Make sure to place your stemware in the proper spot to avoid any damage.",

A properly loaded dishwasher will clean your dishes more effectively and eliminate the need to wash any items by hand.If items like these stick together, they may not get cleaned on the front side of one or the backside of the other.Bonus Tips To ensure your dishes come out sparkling, always use a good quality detergent – whether it’s a liquid or tablet – and always store your detergent in a cool dry place. Periodically check the filters in your dishwasher to make sure they are clean and functioning properly. Check your spray arms to make sure the holes aren’t plugged with any items. If any of the holes are plugged, you will need to clear them. Finally, don’t wash your dishes before you wash your dishes. Scraping off any large food items should be sufficient. Dishwashing detergent is typically a harsh chemical and if there is no food soil to react to, it will react with your dishes and potentially cause serious damage. Properly vs. Improperly Loaded Dishwasher: How Much Difference Does It Make? We took two identical dishwashers to demonstrate what happens when you don’t properly load the dishwasher versus the outcome of a properly loaded dishwasher. For the properly loaded dishwasher we kept lots of space between the dishes and plated all the cutlery with the dirty end up. The same goes for the upper rack. We left lots of space and made sure not to block the sprayer arm. For the unproperly loaded dishwasher we put no effort into the organization of dishware. We just crammed everything in wherever we could fit it. We shoved all the cutlery possible into the cutlery basket without any effort. Before we began our experiment, we made sure to purge the hot water line. This is an important step because typically your first fill will only use cold water that is in the water lines.",

But did you know that by testing a few key parts, you can likely get your dishwasher back up and running again yourself? We'll take you through the key steps in testing the most likely parts to cause the \"won't start\" symptom; get up and running again using our video guide or the text guide featured below: Door Latch Or Door Latch Switch If you cannot get your dishwasher to start, you could have issues the door latch or door latch switches. The door latch assembly holds the door closed when the machine is working, to stop water from leaking. This also includes the door latch switches that power the dishwasher controls. If the door cannot close properly to activate the door latch switches or if the switches are defective, then the dishwasher controls will not receive power and the dishwasher will not start. Inspect the latch assembly including the switches. Using a multimeter to test a dishwasher door latch assembly: Remove the power source from your appliance. Take the inner door panel off to get to the door latch assembly. It is typically located at the top of the door. Once found, verify that the catch activates the door latch switches by pushing it into the assembly. If activating the switches manually, remove the switches to check them for continuity. Using a multimeter set to Rx1, touch the probes to the terminals of the switch. You should get a reading of zero or almost zero. If your reading is not zero or near zero, you will need to order a new door catch assembly . Timer or Electronic Control If the door latch assembly is working and your dishwasher still is not starting, you should next examine the timer or electronic control.",

But did you know that by testing a few key parts, you can likely get your dishwasher back up and running again yourself?Dishwashers normally commence their cycles with a drain function to get rid of any water still in the tub.If you don't audibly hear this drain pump, the timer or electronic control could be the culprit. On dishwashers with manual timers, the timer supplies power to the pump motor, water inlet valve, heater circuit, and drain pump motor when required at the right time in the dishwasher cycle. The timer does this with a sequence of electrical contacts and a small motor that drives them. All of these are located in the timer housing. Testing a dishwasher timer with a multimeter: Remove power from your dishwasher for safety. Find the timer, likely in the control panel or behind the lower kick plate, and take it out. If your timer contains lots of contacts and wires, you will need to use your wiring diagram to find the right contacts to test. Using the Rx1000 setting on your multimeter, use the probes to touch the contacts. A working timer will range from 2000-3500 ohms, but this can vary. Use your appliance's owners' manual to find the right reading for your dishwasher. If your test results differ from the manufacturer's recommendations, you may require a new timer . Selector Switch The dishwasher's selector switch selects various options for the different cycles, for example, heated dry and heated wash cycles. The switch may be used in the motor or fill circuit, if the selector was defective or the buttons were not fully depressed, could cause the dishwasher to not start. Your first check should be whether the buttons are properly depressed.",

But did you know that by testing a few key parts, you can likely get your dishwasher back up and running again yourself?Then, using your schematics as a guide, the contacts can be checked using a multimeter: Testing a dishwasher selector switch with a multimeter: As always, for safety, unplug your dishwasher. Take off the inner door panel of your dishwasher to find the selector switch. It will most likely be located on the control panel. Once found, make sure the switch is appropriately depressed. If it is, the next step is to test it, which will require you to remove it. Set your multimeter to Rx1, and test the terminals of the switch, checking each button individually. You should get an infinite reading if all is functional. Next, with the probes still on the terminals, press the terminal buttons you are testing. This should change your reading to zero. Do this test again for each of the individual buttons If any of your readings do not produce the above results, you should consider a new selector switch . Motor Start Relay Multiple dishwashers utilize start relays on the main pump motor. This part supplies power to the motor start windings until it is running and has a moving plunger inside that operates a set of contacts. If your dishwasher will not start and you have tested the control circuit to the motor, the motor start relay may be the cause. Testing the motor start relay: Remove power to your dishwasher. Locate the motor start relay; usually found next to the pump. Take off your dishwasher's lower access panel to find the motor start relay. You will need to remove the motor start relay to commence testing it after you have located it. Use your wiring diagram, and get your multimeter out. Set it to Rx1 and start by testing the coil portion of the relay for continuity.",

Next we are going to manually activate the relay by turning it upside down and letting the plunger drop. Once it is activated, touch the probes to the terminals of the relay. Again, you should get a result of zero or nearly zero when performing this test.. If you get different results to the ones above, you may need a new motor start relay . Thermal Fuse Some dishwashers, particularly those that are electronic controlled, use a thermal fuse to protect the control board. The thermal fuse can usually be found on top of the circuit board assembly, attached to two wires. If the thermal fuse is defective, the control board won't get power and the result will be a dishwasher that doesn't start. Testing the dishwasher thermal fuse with a multimeter: This is an electrical test, so as always, unplugging the dishwasher is crucial for safety. Take off the inner door to get to the control panel.Locate the thermal fuse and carefully disconnect the two wires and remove the thermal fuse. Using your multimeter on the Rx1 setting, touch the contacts of the fuse with the probes. You should receive a reading of zero or nearly zero if there is continuity. If your reading is different, it's time for a replacement thermal fuse . Drive Motor The drive motor is the part that circulates the dishwasher water to wash the items inside. The timer or the electronic control supply the power to run the drive motor, along with a start relay. If your appliance will not start after the start relay sends power to the motor, the drive motor is likely the culprit for your symptom.",

Additional Dishwasher Options What is the Sanitize Option on a Dishwasher? What are the Different Drying Options on a Dishwasher? What is the Delay Start Option on a Dishwasher? Each time you start a dishwasher cycle, it goes through four different phases: pre-wash, main wash, rinse, and dry. However, there are numerous cycle types to choose from; which one should you be using and what’s the difference between them all? In this article, we’ll discuss the most common cycles found on dishwashers, their different functions, and when you should use them, along with some tips for optimal cleaning. Tips for Getting the Best Results from Your Dishwasher Always scrape your dishes prior to loading them in the machine, but there is no need to fully rinse. The detergent for a dishwasher actually needs some food particles to bind to in order to clean efficiently. If your plates are thoroughly rinsed beforehand, the enzymes in the detergent will break down the surfaces of your dishes instead. This can lead to your dishes looking scratched or cloudy over time. Run the hot water at your kitchen sink to “prime” the lines. This will let the machine spend less time and energy to heat the water up to an appropriate temperature to clean your dishes. Always place the detergent pod in the dispenser, don't just throw it into the wash tub. The dispenser releases the pod at the appropriate time in the washer cycle. If you throw it in the bottom of the machine, it will dissolve in the rinse cycle and be down the drain before the detergent even touches your dishes. Common Dishwasher Cycles and Their Function Depending on the age and technology of your dishwasher, you may have dozens of cycle options to choose from to clean your dishes.",
    "Title: Guide to Dishwasher Cycles. Subtitle: Which is best for cleaning your dishes, and how long does it take?. Tips for Getting the Best Results from Your Dishwasher Common Dishwasher Cycles and Their Function What is a Rinse Cycle on a Dishwasher? What is a Quick Cycle on a Dishwasher? What is a Normal Cycle on a Dishwasher? What is an Eco Cycle on a Dishwasher? What is Auto Mode on a Dishwasher? What is a Heavy Cycle on a Dishwasher?If you’ve just been selecting “normal” every time, there may be an alternative option to fit your dishes' needs. What is a Rinse Cycle on a Dishwasher? This option may also be called Rinse & Hold (GE), Rinse Only (GE, KitchenAid, Frigidaire, Samsung), or Prewash (Maytag). The rinse cycle will prevent food from drying onto your dishes and help prevent any smells from forming. When to Use the Rinse Cycle I know we stated at the start of the article not to rinse your dishes prior to loading, but this cycle has a time and place. It is a handy feature when you’re loading the dishwasher at one time (say after dinner), but don’t plan to run a load until a later time (after breakfast the next day for example). If you are loading the dishwasher and immediately turning it on, there’s no need to do this rinse cycle first, as that’s taken care of during normal operation. How Long Does the Rinse Cycle Take? The rinse cycle is very quick (typically just a few minutes) and is run without detergent. What is a Quick Cycle on a Dishwasher? This will be the shortest cycle that actually washes your dishes. Depending on your model, this cycle may be called Quick Wash (Whirlpool, Frigidaire), Express Wash (KitchenAid, Bosch),1 Hour Wash (Maytag, Frigidaire), or Glass Cycle (GE). When to Use the Quick Cycle This cycle should be used for lightly soiled items, or dishware that you need to clean quickly (such as cooking or baking dishes you want to use again later). The quick cycle is probably not sufficient to clean baked-on food, and it may not fully dry your dishes. How Long Does the Quick Cycle Take? You can expect this option to take between 30-60 minutes to clean your dishes.",

What is a Normal Cycle on a Dishwasher? What is an Eco Cycle on a Dishwasher? What is Auto Mode on a Dishwasher? What is a Heavy Cycle on a Dishwasher?What is a Normal Cycle on a Dishwasher? The normal cycle on a dishwasher may also be called Standard or Regular. This is the typical setting most will use, as it will provide a thorough clean for daily-use dishes. When to Use the Normal Cycle Unless you have heavily soiled cookware, or other special washing needs, this cycle option will fit the bill. When running a full load, this option is going to be more energy efficient and likely save you time over hand washing every dish. How Long Does the Normal Cycle Take? A normal cycle can take between 1.5 to 2 hours to complete. What is an Eco Cycle on a Dishwasher? The Eco cycle uses less energy and water by using a lower water temperature and less water but extends the cycle length, so that you still have thoroughly cleaned dishes. It may be called an Eco Mode, Eco (Bosch), or Energy Saver (Frigidaire) as well. When to Use an Eco Cycle If you aren’t concerned with the length the cycle runs for, this option could replace the “normal” one if your model of dishwasher has it. An eco cycle works great for regular-use dishes but may not be suitable for heavily soiled or burnt-on food. It may not fully dry your dishes either, in order to conserve energy. How Long Does an Eco Cycle Take? The run time will vary depending on your model, but you can expect an Eco cycle to take about 3 hours to complete. What is Auto Mode on a Dishwasher? More modern dishwashers have sensors, which can detect how dirty your dishes are. The sensor will relay this information, and the dishwasher will adjust the water level, temperatures, and length of the cycle to ensure your dishes are fully cleaned.",

What is a Normal Cycle on a Dishwasher? What is an Eco Cycle on a Dishwasher? What is Auto Mode on a Dishwasher? What is a Heavy Cycle on a Dishwasher?What is a Normal Cycle on a Dishwasher?Other names for this type of cycle include Sensor (Frigidaire, Whirlpool, Maytag), ProWash (KitchenAid), AutoSense (GE), Smart Auto (Samsung) and Mixed-Load. When to Use Auto Mode This option can replace the default “normal” cycle option, as it will adjust each time you run a load of dishes for an optimal clean. The auto mode is also ideal if you are washing a variety of items, such as pots and pans with your regular plates and cutlery. How Long Does an Auto Mode Cycle Take? This cycle can take longer to complete, and the time will vary with each use. You can expect your dishwasher to run for 2 to 3 hours, depending on how dirty the dishes are. Similar to a washing machine with sensors, the “time left” on display may fluctuate throughout the cycle. What is a Heavy Cycle on a Dishwasher? This cycle is meant for your most soiled dishes and cookware. It may also go by Heavy Wash (Frigidaire), Pots & Pans (Samsung), Cookware, Heavy Soil, Tough (KitchenAid), or Intensive. This cycle is going to use higher temperatures and more water to get the job done, but that’s what it takes to tackle burnt on messes or greasy cookware. When to Use a Heavy Cycle This won’t be (and shouldn’t be) your go-to daily use cycle. You’ll most likely use this one after a busy cooking day, such as when doing meal-prep or hosting a holiday meal. How Long Does a Heavy Cycle Take? You can expect a heavy cycle to take at least 3 hours to complete. Additional Dishwasher Options Dishwashers have additional options you can select to better suit your needs.

What is the Sanitize Option on a Dishwasher? The sanitize option will reach temperatures hot enough to kill 99.99% of food related bacteria. It should be noted that sanitizing and sterilizing are two different functions, and household dishwashers do not get hot enough to sterilize your dishes (the water needs to be at least 250F). Depending on your model, this option may be called Sanitize Cycle, SaniWash, Sani-Rinse, High-Temp Rinse. This is a setting you select in addition to a regular cycle, and the machine will then perform a final rinse at a higher temperature (at least 150F) to sanitize your items. When to Use the Sanitize Option This option should be selected when you have items like baby bottles, cutting boards or dishes that touched raw meat, or cleaning dishes while there's cold and flu bugs in the house. How Long Does Sanitizing Take on a Dishwasher? Sanitizing can add up to an extra hour to your regular wash cycle. What are the Different Drying Options on a Dishwasher? Selecting a dry option on your dishwasher can add extra time to the cycle, and be a significant source of energy consumption. Below are some of the most common dry options, including some energy efficient choices. Heat Dry Selecting the heat dry option on your dishwasher will turn on the heating element at the bottom of the tub after the rinse phase. The heat will circulate through the tub and help the water evaporate from your dishes faster.",

What is a Heavy Cycle on a Dishwasher?What is a Normal Cycle on a Dishwasher?If you are opting to use a heat dry option, be sure to load any plastic dishes on the top rack of the dishwasher to prevent them from melting. Using this option can add an extra 30 minutes to the total cycle time. Extended Dry The extended dry option functions similar to a regular heat dry but runs for a longer amount of time. This option will increase your dishwasher's energy use and will lengthen the overall cycle time. Heated Rinse The heated rinse option will use a hotter water temperature at the end of the cycle. The hot water will evaporate quicker, leaving you with dry dishes. Fan Dry For an energy savings option, use fan dry instead of a heated dry. This option uses a fan to circulate either room temperature or hot air(which is less economical but efficient at drying). Air Dry This feature is found on newer dishwasher models, where the door will automatically pop open to allow the steam to escape from the tub. If your machine doesn’t have this option, you can replicate the results by manually cracking open the dishwasher door once the cycle has finished. What is the Delay Start Option on a Dishwasher? The delay start option on a dishwasher allows you to pre-select a cycle, and then a later time for it to actually run. Depending on your model, there may be a set delay (4 hours later for example) or you can choose the time, typically in one-hour increments. When to Use the Delay Start Option In many areas, energy costs are lower overnight, so scheduling the dishwasher to run after you’ve gone to bed can help save on your utility bills.",

When food is stored at the optimal temperature, it prevents harmful bacteria from growing. So what temperature is ideal for both your fresh food in the fridge, and frozen items in the freezer? Is the coldest setting the best to use? In this article we’ll discuss the different options for your fridge and freezer, food storage tips, and how to adjust the settings for your refrigerator. What is the Proper Temperature for a Fridge and Freezer? To prevent foodborne illnesses, your fridge needs to be kept at a temperature under 40F (4C). The ideal range however is between 35-38F (or approximately 1-3C) so that your food is thoroughly chilled without freezing. To keep the items in your freezer frozen solid, you will want the temperature to be set to 0F or lower (-18C or colder). An inexpensive thermometer placed in the fridge can help ensure that the appliance is set to (and maintaining) the correct temperature. Some factors to consider when it comes to your fridge temperature are the age of appliance and how full it is. An older or fully stocked fridge may need a lower setting to maintain a cooler temperature. It’s important to note that you shouldn’t jam your fridge or freezer full, as air flow is essential to maintaining the temperature.

The lower the number, the warmer the temperature. If you set the dial at “1” it should keep your fridge around 39F, whereas a setting of 5 should be around 33F so that your food doesn’t freeze. Most models will have an “ideal temperature” marker on the dial. This is a good setting to start with, and you can then adjust the temperature dial from there if you need more or less cooling. Adjusting the Fridge Temperature with a Digital Display If you have a fridge with a digital control board, you should be able to select the exact temperature you want for the fridge and freezer. As mentioned above, your fridge should be below 40F to prevent bacteria from growing, and the freezer should be below 0F to keep your food frozen. The process to select the temperature will vary depending on your fridge model, but it should be very straightforward, typically just pushing an up-arrow or down-arrow button to adjust the temperature. How to Properly Store Your Food in a Fridge While the temperature in your fridge is essential to prevent bacteria from growing, where you place different foods in your fridge also helps keep things fresher for longer.

Do not use a wire brush or scouring pad (also known as a hard sponge), because they may damage the filter. Open the dishwasher door and remove the lower dish rack. Locate the filters at the bottom of the dishwasher. Some models may only have one, but many have two; an upper filter and a lower one. Rotate the upper filter assembly a quarter-turn counterclockwise, and lift it out to remove it. With the upper filter out, pull on the lower filter where the upper filter was, then lift it up and pull it out. Run both filters under warm water until all food particles are gone. Any harder to remove particles or calcium deposits may require the use of a small bristle brush to clean off. Once both filters are cleaned, put the lower filter in first by placing each side under their respective locating tabs, and ensure the circular hole in the filter is lined up with the round opening underneath. Insert the upper filter in the opening of the lower filter, and slowly rotate it clockwise until it drops. Once it drops, rotate it clockwise again until it locks in place. If you notice an arrow on the filter, it does not need to be lined up with anything, Just make sure the filter is locked in place and cannot freely rotate.

Tip # 1: Organize Your Refrigerator for Efficiency Tip # 2: Check for Proper Air Flow Tip # 3: Cool Items Before Putting Them in the Fridge Tip # 4: Utilize the Features in Your Refrigerator Tip #5: Properly Maintain Your Refrigerator Tip # 6: Set the Correct Temperature Are rising energy costs a major concern for you? Are you interested in trying to find out ways to maximize the efficiency of your home appliances? We'd like to share with you some energy-saving tips for your refrigerator , to help cut down on costs, and of course, make a difference for the environment. How Does a Refrigerator Work? To help you with energy costs with your refrigerator, one of the first things that you'll want to consider is how a refrigerator works. Basically, how the refrigeration process works is you remove heat from food items and then dissipate that heat into the atmosphere. Keeping that in mind, every time you open the refrigerator door, you introduce more heat into that refrigerator and therefore it must work harder to get rid of it. Tip # 1: Organize Your Refrigerator for Efficiency The first tip is to properly organize your refrigerator so that you don't stand with the door open while you're searching for an item. Using labels or see-through containers are a surefire way to minimize the amount of time that you spend looking for things and leaving the refrigerator door open. You should also keep items you use on a regular basis kept on the front of the shelves. Those things that you rarely use should be placed at the back of the fridge. Also, keep in mind that not all food items need to be refrigerated, such as soy sauce. Some fruits and vegetables can be kept in a container on your countertop. Be sure to check the labels on your food to determine whether the items need to be refrigerated. Tip # 2: Check for Proper Air Flow Related to the topic of organizing your refrigerator, you'll also want to keep in mind how much you can put in your model of refrigerator.",
    "Title: 6 Fridge Energy Saving Tips. Subtitle: Reduce Your Energy Bill and Environmental Impact. How Does a Refrigerator Work? Tip # 1: Organize Your Refrigerator for Efficiency Tip # 2: Check for Proper Air Flow Tip # 3: Cool Items Before Putting Them in the Fridge Tip # 4: Utilize the Features in Your Refrigerator Tip #5: Properly Maintain Your Refrigerator Tip # 6: Set the Correct Temperature Are rising energy costs a major concern for you?For a refrigerator to work efficiently, it needs to have room for air to flow between the shelves. Air will enter the fresh food compartment on any refrigerator, circulate around and exit back into the evaporator area, which is typically located at the back of the freezer. When you impede the airflow, this causes the refrigerator to work that much harder to maintain a proper temperature. Keep that in mind, it is important that we don't block the air inlet ducts into the fresh food compartment or the return air vents that go back to the freezer. If you find that you need to fill your refrigerator completely, you should look at getting a larger size. Tip # 3: Cool Items Before Putting Them in the Fridge Now, along with organizing your refrigerator to minimize door openings, on days that you purchase food items that need to be refrigerated, we suggest that you cool them during the transportation process. Simply putting them in a cooler with a few blocks of ice or adding your frozen foods into a cooler along with your refrigerated foods allows them to stay cool before they get introduced into your refrigerator. Any time you add room-temperature food items to your refrigerator, it has to work that much harder to bring that temperature back down to normal. Also, if you are into pre-cooking meals or saving leftovers, allow those to come down to room temperature before introducing them into the refrigerator. Tip # 4: Utilize the Features in Your Refrigerator Utilize the features that are present in your refrigerator. Some models will have an energy saver switch that turns an electric heater on or off.",

If your refrigerator model has a through-the-door ice and water dispenser, you should also utilize that feature. That prevents opening the door and allowing room air temperature into your freezer or your fresh food compartment. Another energy-saving tip is that if you're going to take some frozen food to thaw out, simply put it in the fresh food compartment and allow it to thaw out there. Tip #5: Properly Maintain Your Refrigerator There are also a few maintenance items that you should pay attention to that will help you save money. First, inspect the door gaskets on both the fresh food compartment and the freezer to ensure they're making a nice tight seal. Any time air can leak into that refrigerator, your compressor will run longer to maintain that temperature, so make sure that the gaskets are pliable and in good condition. If there are any tears or deformations to them, they should be replaced. Tip # 6: Set the Correct Temperature The last tip on our list is properly setting your refrigerator controls for the fresh food compartment and the freezer. For the fresh food compartment, the optimum temperature is somewhere around two or three degrees Celsius or 37.38 degrees Fahrenheit. Typically, for a freezer, you’ll want -18 degrees Celsius or zero to five degrees Fahrenheit. Make sure your controls are set to maintain those temperatures. To check those temperatures, we suggest that you use an excellent-quality probe-type thermometer.",

Allow another 24 hours before recording the temperature again. In the freezer, we found the best item to use is ice cream. Simply insert the probe into the ice cream and check the temperature. We hope that some of these tips will help you save money on your next power bill and save you much more if you continue to follow them!

    "Title: Proper Fridge Food Storage. Subtitle: Improve Your Food Waste by Strategically Storing Your Food. Temperature Zones in Your Refrigerator What Should I Store in my Crisper Drawers? What Need's a Low Humidity Setting? What Need's a High Humidity Setting? Tips for Storing Food in The Freezer If you come home from the grocery store and just shove food into the fridge wherever it will fit, then I imagine you end up throwing a lot of it out in a few weeks’ time. To help you save some money, help the planet and consume food safely, we’re going to show you how proper food storage can make a huge difference! Temperature Zones in Your Refrigerator You may typically set one control to a specific temperature inside your refrigerator, but what you may not realize is that the fresh food compartment has different temperature zones. Normally you will find that the upper shelves and the doors will be the warmest areas and the bottom shelves and crispers will be cooler. The door or doors on your fresh food compartment are going to be warmer zones. So, while it is tempting to keep items that you want easy access to on the doors, milk cartons and eggs should be kept somewhere else. As a rule of thumb, try placing less perishable items such as condiments on the door bins. Although the upper shelves are a slightly warmer location in your refrigerator, they are also very easily accessible and an ideal spot for snacks and leftovers. Keep in mind that this is also the area that the cold air enters your fresh food compartment, therefore you’ll want to be sure that you don’t place perishable items directly in that airflow. Since cold air drops, the bottom shelves are going to be the coolest part of your refrigerator. This makes it the ideal location for storing such things as raw meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs. What Should I Store in my Crisper Drawers? Do you know the proper settings and which foods to keep in your crisper drawers? Most crisper drawers will have a feature that will allow you to choose between a low or high humidity within them. The controls are usually either a slider control or adjustable dial that you can choose between a low and high humidity.",

Tips for Storing Food in The Freezer If you come home from the grocery store and just shove food into the fridge wherever it will fit, then I imagine you end up throwing a lot of it out in a few weeks’ time.If your crisper drawers do not have this option, by default they are considered high humidity drawers. This is due to the lack of airflow into and out of the crisper. What Need's a Low Humidity Setting? Generally, fruit will be the main items being stored in a low humidity setting. The reason for keeping fruit in the low humidity drawer is because many fruits produce ethylene as they ripen, which in turn speeds up the ripening or rotting process of surrounding produce. The increased airflow in a low-humidity crisper drawer lets some ethylene gas escape. What Need's a High Humidity Setting? High humidity drawer items that are prone to moisture loss or welting should be stored in a high humidity crisper drawer. Items like leafy greens, herbs, and vegetables in general, should be kept here. Since the drawer is sealed off from the rest of the refrigerator, the produce is not exposed to the ethylene gas. The humid environment helps keep the produce fresh for longer, which explains the name crisper drawer. Tips for Storing Food in The Freezer Food kept in the freezer will generally be safe to eat for months on end, as long as it has stayed frozen the entire time. The quality of the food, however, may diminish over time. Qualities like the color, smell, taste or texture of the food can change. Freezer burned food is still safe to eat but the quality will suffer the most. The best way to prevent freezer burn is to properly store the food. For example, don’t freeze meat in the original foam tray you bought it in. Any plastic bags or containers you use should be freezer-grade quality. Air is the ultimate enemy, so make sure lids and seals are airtight.",

Don't forget to remove any trays or baskets, and give those a thorough cleaning as well. It's also a good idea to wipe down the door gaskets, as they are often clogged with dirt and grime. Change Your Refrigerator's Water Filter This step won't be necessary for everyone, since not everyone has a water filter, and everyone changes their water filter at different intervals, but if it's been more than 6 months since you've last changed your water filter, it may be time to swap it for a new one. Changing the filter will ensure that the water that comes from your refrigerator's water dispenser will be properly filtered (and the ice that comes from the ice maker will be as well!), To find the water filter that's right for your refrigerator, check out our Water Filter Finder . Adjust Your Shelving and Get Organized In order to properly organize your refrigerator, you'll want to ensure that your shelves are at the correct height and orientation. Every fridge is a little bit different, so you'll have to work with what you have for this step. When adjusting your rack heights, it's important to consider what you'll be filling the refrigerator up with later. Will you be putting an entire box of beer or soda in the fridge? Well, it's probably important to leave one section with some extra space to accommodate that.",

Again, it's important to do what's right for YOU in this situation, as everyone's fridge and everyone's individual needs will be a little different! Adjust Your Refrigerator Temperature This step is one that people often forget or don't consider at all. When you have party guests, or even making a complicated meal in your kitchen day-to-day, it's a good idea to adjust your refrigerator's temperature to make things just a little bit colder. The reason for this is that if you have guests serving themselves beverages (or if you're doing the bartending), or you're adding and removing food items often, the refrigerator door will be constantly opening and closing. This can cause the refrigerator's temperature to rise slightly, and this can impact the refrigerator's ability to keep everything cold. If you lower the temperature of the refrigerator ever so slightly, you can compensate for the constant opening and closing of the door, and keep everything nice and cold for your guests! Like anything in life, there are always going to be a number of different ways that you can prepare your refrigerator for a gathering, and these are just some of the tips that we find work well for hosting a party. You're going to understand your own situation the best, so make sure that everything you do in preparation for your party suits your own needs.
