    "Symptom: Ice maker not making ice. Appliance: refrigerator. Difficulty: EASY. Part: Water Inlet Valve. Description: Some water inlet valves may have a screen to filter debris before it can enter the valve. If the screen is plugged, water flow will be restricted, and the result will be small or layered ice cubes. Remove and clean the screen if it is clogged. If dirt has gotten into the valve it may not shut off completely and will continuously drip water into the ice maker fill tube and will eventually freeze up. Low household water pressure or a restriction at the manual shut off valve will also cause the water inlet valve to not shut off completely and create this same condition. Self piercing saddle valves are the most common shut off valve to cause this problem as the hole that is pierced in the water line is often too small and will more easily become restricted.

Once you have diagnosed the problem we have theOEM replacement defrost timerthat fits your appliance. Before you begin to test your defrost timer, make sure you disconnect the appliance's power supply. The easiest way to do this is to unplug the unit from the wall. Alternatively, you could trip the appropriate switch in the circuit breaker panel, or you could remove the appropriate fuse from your home's fuse box. Consult with an appliance repair technician if you do not feel you have the skill or the ability to successfully complete this repair. Locate your defrost timer. It can be located behind the refrigerator's lower kickplate, in the refrigerator's control panel, or even behind the refrigerator on its back wall. Defrost timers almost always have four metallic terminals extending from the bottom. Once you have found your refrigerator's defrost timer, remove it for testing. A defrost timer is usually secured inside a refrigerator with at least one screw, but sometimes more. Remove all the screws you find and pull the timer carefully out of the refrigerator. Pull it out far enough so that you can disconnect its wires. Pull firmly on the wire's connectors to remove them. You may need to rock them back and forth a little to ease the motion. Don't worry about which way the connector comes out because there is only one way it can go back in. Use your multitester to test the timer for continuity. Set your multitester to the R X 1 scale. Place one of the tester's leads on the coommon terminal. It should be labeled \"3\" or \"C\". If none of the terminals are labeled, you can locate the common terminal by determining which terminal coincides with the white wire in the connector plug. With one multitester lead (probe) touching the common terminal, touch the other lead to the other three remaining terminals, one at a time. Testing the first pair should produce a reading of zero, or near zero, denoting continuity. The second pair may also result in a reading of zero or near zero. Testing the third pair of terminals should produce a reading of infinity. Find your refrigerator's timer switch and turn it in a clockwise motion until it clicks. Use your multitester and test the terminals again in the same manner as in the preceding paragraph. In this test, one of the pairs of terminals should produce a reading of continuity. At least one pair, but maybe two, should produce a reading of infinity. One important note to keep in mind is that a pair of terminals that demonstrated continuity in the first test should now demonstrate infinity. Likewise, a pair of terminals that demonstrated infinity in the first test should now demonstrate continuity. If the test you conduct with your defrost timer does not produce these results, then you should replace the mechaninsm.

    "Symptom: Leaking. Appliance: dishwasher. Difficulty: EASY. Part: Water Inlet Valve. Description: The water inlet valve feeds the water from your home’s main water line into the dishwasher and could be the source of a leak. The inlet valve can be found behind the lower kick plate. The hot water inlet supply to the valve may be copper tubing, rubber hose or braided hose. How to test a dishwasher water inlet valve:. Guide: How to replace a water inlet valve. Steps: This step-by-step guide teaches you how to replace the water inlet valve in your dishwasher. Find the officialOEM replacement water valvethat fits your appliance. Locate your dishwasher's water inlet valve. It should be located behind the lower kickplate panel in either the right or left corner. There will likely be two screws either on the top of the panel, or on its bottom. Remove these two screws, and then remove the kickplate. On some dishwasher models, the door has to be opened in order to gain access to, and remove the kickplate's screws. Close the door before you remove the kickplate panel. You will be able to identify the water inlet valve by the hoses that connect to it. There will be one hose feeding water from the house to the water valve, and another hose leading from the water valve that carries water away. Now is a good time to inspect your dishwasher's hoses, to make sure they aren't responsible for any water flow problems. Make sure the hoses are securely connected to the valve. Also check to make sure there are not kinks in the hoses.Turn off your dishwasher's water supply so that you can remove the hose attached to the water valve. The water supply turn-off is located beneath your sink. There will be a knob to turn or a lever to press down on. Alternatively, you can turn off the main water supply to your house at the main valve. Place a container below the hose to catch the water that falls out when you disconnect it. The hose that brings water to the valve will most likely screw in place like a garden hose. The hose that carries water away from the valve is probably held in place with a clamp. There will be two wires connected to the water inlet valve. If your dishwasher's water inlet valve has two solenoids, then there will be four wires. Label the wires so that you will be able to correctly reconnect them later. The wires are connected using slip-on connectors. Grasp the connectors and pull on them firmly in order to disconnect the wires from the valve's terminals. Do not pull on the wires themselves. You may want to use a pair of needle nosed pliers to help you. The valve itself will be secured to the dishwasher using at least two screws, but maybe more. Remove all the screws you find that hold the valve in place. Now you can remove the valve as well. Install your new water inlet valve in the same location where you just removed the old one. Secure it in place using the screws removed from the old valve. Reconnect the wires and hoses. Replace the lower kickplate panel and restore power to your dishwasher.

Guide: How to check a timer. Steps: Use our step-by-step dishwasher repair guide to learn how to test your timer. Once you have diagnosed the problem we have theOEM replacement timerthat fits your appliance. The purpose of a dishwasher timer is to control the unit's cycles by regulating the length of time that power is directed to each component. It is not common for dishwasher timers to malfunction, and they are often misdiagnosed as having failed when they are actually fully operational. TIP:If you do have a timer motor that has failed, consider replacing just the motor itself and not the entire assembly. Timer motors can be considerably cheaper than the complete timer assembly. Before you can begin to test your dishwasher's timer motor, you must first locate the device. It is a part of the timer assembly. Timer assemblies are located either in the control panel at the top of the dishwasher door, or behind the lower kickplate at the bottom of the unit. To get to a timer located in the unit's control panel, first examine the outside of the appliance. Sometimes, depending on the model, you only have to remove a couple of screws in order to remove the outer control panel. In other cases, you will have to remove either the entire internal door panel, or the entire external door panel. In each case, the panel can be removed by removing anywhere from 6 - 10 screws. Be careful to not remove the screws at the very bottom of the door that are actually a part of the hinge assembly. Removing the hinge assembly screws will remove the entire door from the appliance, which is not at all necessary to test the unit's timer. With all of the screws removed, the door panel should be easy to lift off of the door assembly. If you have difficulty lifting the panel, look for other screws you may have missed. There may or may not be a smaller control panel cover. If you do discover one, it will be held in place with either a couple of screws or a couple of clips. With the dishwasher's control components fully exposed, you may discover that your model uses two timer motors. The second one will be a rapid advance motor. It is operational when the wash cycle is cancelled or reset. If you are unsure which timer is which, then test each of them. To get to a dishwasher timer located behind the lower kickplate at the bottom of the unit, simply remove the few screws holding the kickplate panel in place. With the panel removed, you will be able to identify and locate the timer and its motor. There will be two wires extending from the round motor housing. Follow the wires until you locate the connectors. Label the wires so that you will be able to reconnect them later in the right positions. Carefully remove the wires. Do not pull on the wire itself. Needle nose pliers may be needed to pull gently on the wire connector. Set your ohmmeter to the x 1000 setting. Take each probe and touch it to one wire. A normal reading for most dishwashers is in the 2000 to 3500 ohms range. Try to locate a schematic for your dishwasher. It should be in one of the service areas of your dishwasher or in the owner's manual. This schematic should indicate the proper resistance reading for your specific timer motor. If the reading you receive from testing your timer's motor differs greatly from the range presented here, then you should replace your timer motor, or the entire timer assembly.

Steps: Use our step-by-step dishwasher repair guide to learn how to test your timer. Once you have diagnosed the problem we have theOEM replacement timerthat fits your appliance. The purpose of a dishwasher timer is to control the unit's cycles by regulating the length of time that power is directed to each component. It is not common for dishwasher timers to malfunction, and they are often misdiagnosed as having failed when they are actually fully operational. TIP:If you do have a timer motor that has failed, consider replacing just the motor itself and not the entire assembly. Timer motors can be considerably cheaper than the complete timer assembly. Before you can begin to test your dishwasher's timer motor, you must first locate the device. It is a part of the timer assembly. Timer assemblies are located either in the control panel at the top of the dishwasher door, or behind the lower kickplate at the bottom of the unit. To get to a timer located in the unit's control panel, first examine the outside of the appliance. Sometimes, depending on the model, you only have to remove a couple of screws in order to remove the outer control panel. In other cases, you will have to remove either the entire internal door panel, or the entire external door panel. In each case, the panel can be removed by removing anywhere from 6 - 10 screws. Be careful to not remove the screws at the very bottom of the door that are actually a part of the hinge assembly. Removing the hinge assembly screws will remove the entire door from the appliance, which is not at all necessary to test the unit's timer. With all of the screws removed, the door panel should be easy to lift off of the door assembly. If you have difficulty lifting the panel, look for other screws you may have missed. There may or may not be a smaller control panel cover. If you do discover one, it will be held in place with either a couple of screws or a couple of clips. With the dishwasher's control components fully exposed, you may discover that your model uses two timer motors. The second one will be a rapid advance motor. It is operational when the wash cycle is cancelled or reset. If you are unsure which timer is which, then test each of them. To get to a dishwasher timer located behind the lower kickplate at the bottom of the unit, simply remove the few screws holding the kickplate panel in place. With the panel removed, you will be able to identify and locate the timer and its motor. There will be two wires extending from the round motor housing. Follow the wires until you locate the connectors. Label the wires so that you will be able to reconnect them later in the right positions. Carefully remove the wires. Do not pull on the wire itself. Needle nose pliers may be needed to pull gently on the wire connector. Set your ohmmeter to the x 1000 setting. Take each probe and touch it to one wire. A normal reading for most dishwashers is in the 2000 to 3500 ohms range. Try to locate a schematic for your dishwasher. It should be in one of the service areas of your dishwasher or in the owner's manual. This schematic should indicate the proper resistance reading for your specific timer motor. If the reading you receive from testing your timer's motor differs greatly from the range presented here, then you should replace your timer motor, or the entire timer assembly.

Find the officialOEM replacement water valvethat fits your appliance. Locate your dishwasher's water inlet valve. It should be located behind the lower kickplate panel in either the right or left corner. There will likely be two screws either on the top of the panel, or on its bottom. Remove these two screws, and then remove the kickplate. On some dishwasher models, the door has to be opened in order to gain access to, and remove the kickplate's screws. Close the door before you remove the kickplate panel. You will be able to identify the water inlet valve by the hoses that connect to it. There will be one hose feeding water from the house to the water valve, and another hose leading from the water valve that carries water away. Now is a good time to inspect your dishwasher's hoses, to make sure they aren't responsible for any water flow problems. Make sure the hoses are securely connected to the valve. Also check to make sure there are not kinks in the hoses.Turn off your dishwasher's water supply so that you can remove the hose attached to the water valve. The water supply turn-off is located beneath your sink. There will be a knob to turn or a lever to press down on. Alternatively, you can turn off the main water supply to your house at the main valve. Place a container below the hose to catch the water that falls out when you disconnect it. The hose that brings water to the valve will most likely screw in place like a garden hose. The hose that carries water away from the valve is probably held in place with a clamp. There will be two wires connected to the water inlet valve. If your dishwasher's water inlet valve has two solenoids, then there will be four wires. Label the wires so that you will be able to correctly reconnect them later. The wires are connected using slip-on connectors. Grasp the connectors and pull on them firmly in order to disconnect the wires from the valve's terminals. Do not pull on the wires themselves. You may want to use a pair of needle nosed pliers to help you. The valve itself will be secured to the dishwasher using at least two screws, but maybe more. Remove all the screws you find that hold the valve in place. Now you can remove the valve as well. Install your new water inlet valve in the same location where you just removed the old one. Secure it in place using the screws removed from the old valve. Reconnect the wires and hoses. Replace the lower kickplate panel and restore power to your dishwasher.

The float rises with the water level in the dishwasher and when the proper level is reached, the float will trigger the float switch to turn off the water inlet valve. How to check a dishwasher float assembly:. Guide: How to check the float. Steps: To inspect the float assembly for proper operation, start by opening the dishwasher door and then remove the lower dish rack. If your dishwasher has a stationary cover over the float assembly, it will need to be removed next. It will either snap in place, or be secured with a screw. Lift the float and let it drop several times. The float should move freely in the guide tube. If there is a restriction, you will need to remove the float to correct it. The float may simply lift out of the guide tube or may have a retainer attached to the end of the stem that keeps it from becoming dislodged. To detach any retainer, you will have to remove the lower access panel first. The access panel is normally held in place with a couple of screws at either end. With the panel removed you will be able to detach any retainer on the stem, and remove the float to inspect the guide tube for any foreign debris that may be causing a restriction. Check the stem of the float to make sure that it is clean and straight. A float that is warped or damaged will need to be replaced. If you have found any debris in the guide tube make sure to clean it thoroughly. Replace the float assembly and retainer. Route any wires or hoses that might impede the movement of the float or float switch away from the assembly. Check the mechanical operation again to verify that it moves freely. Replace the float cover if your model has one. Replace the lower dish rack and restore power to your dishwasher and run it through a cycle to test it. Replace the access panel if the problem was resolved. If the dishwasher is still overfilling, the problem may be with the float switch or the water inlet valve.

Find the officialOEM replacement float assemblythat fits your appliance. Your float assembly is found inside the dishwasher's tub, on the bottom. The water that fills your dishwasher lifts the float, and when it reaches a certain level, it acts as a trigger for the float switch. The float triggers the float switch to shut off, thereby shutting off the flow of water into the dishwasher. Open the dishwasher door and remove the lower dishrack. If your dishwasher has a cover over your float assembly, remove it now. A float's cover is stationary - it does not move up and down. It will either snap in place, or be held in place with a screw. Floats usually snap into place, and replacing it is fairly simple: insert the new float assembly where you've just removed the old one. However, if you are unable to remove yours just by pulling on it, it may be connected to the float switch. If this is the case, you will need to disconnect it from the switch. On some models, the assembly's throat is removeable, and on some they are not. If the float assembly throat on your dishwasher is removeable, it will likely screw out or be held in place with nuts, and you should remove it now. Now, if your float is attached to the float switch, you can access the area where they meet by removing the lower kickplate panel. This panel will either be held in place with a few screws, hooks, clips, or pressure snaps. If no screws are present, the panel should lift up and off, or it should pull off straight out towards you. The float switch connects to an actuator lever that is attached to the float switch. Disconnect the lever from the switch and discard old float assembly. Replace with new float assembly and attach the actuator lever to the float switch. If you have removed the throat, replace that now too. Replace the lower kickplate panel and dishrack. Close the door and restore power to the dishwasher. For more information about the float assembly in your dishwasher: How tocheck a dishwasher float assembly.

If the door switch or switches are malfunctioning the dishwasher will not fill with water. How to test a dishwasher door switch with a multimeter:. Guide: How to test a door switch. Steps: Use our step-by-step dishwasher repair guide to learn how to test your door switch. Once you have diagnosed the problem we have theOEM replacement door switchthat fits your appliance. Before you test the door switch, examine the prong attached to the inside of your dishwasher tub. This prong comes in contact with and activates the door switch when the door is closed. Perhaps the prong on the inside of your dishwasher is missing or damaged, leaving it incapable of activating the door switch. A door switch is a simple on/off mechanism that prohibits the dishwasher from operating when the door is open. Dishwasher door switches are only an inch long. Most are black in color and all have metal prongs, called terminals, extending out from the body of the switch. Some door switches have only two metal prongs extending from the body, while others have three. Those with three terminals will have a common (COM) terminal, a normally closed (N.C.) terminal, and a normally open (N.O.) terminal. Those switches with only two terminals will have either a common terminal and a normally open terminal, or a common terminal and a normally closed terminal. We are providing directions for testing a door switch with three terminals. If you are dealing with a door switch that has only two terminals, ignore the part of this test that does not apply to you. Locate your dishwasher's door switch. The control panel in the front of the unit may be easily removeable, allowing you access to the switch. In some cases, you will have to first remove the inner panel of the dishwasher door. This is usually accomplished with the removal of a few screws. Be careful to not remove the screws at the bottom of the door that are actually a part of the hinge assembly. Removing these screws will remove the door from the unit, which is unnecessary for this test. With the inner door panel removed, you may or may not discover an even smaller panel covering the back of the control panel at the top of the dishwasher door. This smaller panel is held in place with either a couple of screws, or a couple of clips. The switch you are looking for will be located behind this much smaller panel and it is commonly integrated with the door latch assembly. Using caution, remove all wiring harness leads from the switch's terminals. You may need to use needle nose pliers to pull gently not on the wire itself, but on the metallic wire connector. Be aware that some door switches may have a locking clip keeping the harness from coming loose. In this case, there is a protruding lever which must be depressed while the harness is gently pulled away from the terminal. Use your ohmmeter to test your switch for continuity. Begin by setting your ohmmeter to measure resistance at a scale of Rx1. Touch the metal tips of the test leads together and zero your ohmmeter by adjusting the thumbwheel in the front of the meter until the needle reads '0' on the scale. Touch one meter lead to the COM terminal and the other lead to the N.O. terminal. Do not push in on the actuator. Your meter should give a reading of infinity, meaning the circuit is open, and there is no continuity. Without moving the meter's leads, press down on the actuator until you hear a 'click'. With the 'click' of the actuator, the meter should produce a resistance reading of zero ohms. This means the circuit is closed and continuity is present. Keep the meter lead that is touching the COM terminal in place, but move the other meter lead from the N.O. terminal to the N.C. terminal. You should receive a reading of infinity when you push in on the switch's actuator. When the actuator is released, you should receive a resistance reading of zero ohms. Now, set your ohmmeter to its highest resistance scale and touch one meter lead to the N.O. terminal and the other meter lead to the N.C. terminal. The resistance reading between these two leads should be infinite. Finally, take a resistance reading from both the N.C. terminal and the N.O. terminal to any metal mounting hardware that is a part of the switch assembly. You should receive a normal reading of infinity. Any readings that differ from the ones presented here are indicative of a defective door switch that will need to be replaced.

The bi-metal release uses electric current to create a mechanical action to release the door catch. How to test a dishwasher bi-metal release with a multimeter:. Guide: How to replace a bi-metal release. Steps: This step-by-step guide teaches you how to replace the bimetal switch in your dishwasher. Find the officialOEM replacement bimetal switchthat fits your appliance. Before you can begin to replace your dishwasher's bi-metal switch, you must first locate the device. It is located within the door assembly, in very close proximity to the detergent dispenser cup. You will need to gain access to the inside of the door. Examine the outside of the appliance. Depending on the model, you will have to remove either the entire internal door panel, or the entire external door panel. In each case, the panel can be removed by removing anywhere from 6 - 10 screws. Be careful to not remove the screws at the very bottom of the door that are actually a part of the hinge assembly. Removing the hinge assembly screws will remove the entire door from the appliance, which is not at all necessary to replace the unit's bi-metal switch. With all of the screws removed, the door panel should be easy to lift off of the door assembly. If you have difficulty lifting the panel, look for additional screws you may have missed. With the door panel removed, locate your dishwasher's detergent dispenser cup and the bi-metal switch assembly. Before you begin to test the switch, you should first check its alignment. If the detergent cup door is open, shut it. Use a small screwdriver to gently push in on the metal until the door of the detergent cup opens. It might just be that the switch has fallen out of alignment. Sometimes, only a slight adjustment is needed to allow the switch to open the detergent cup door. If this is not the case with your dishwasher, continue with the replacement. There are two wires connected to the bi-metal switch. Label them so that you will be able to correctly reconnect them later. Remove each of the two wires from their respective terminals - they are connected with slip-on connectors. When removing the wires, grasp the connectors and pull firmly. Do not pull on the wires themselves. You may want to use a pair of needle-nosed pliers to help you. Now you can remove the screws that hold the switch to the detergent dispenser cup. Discard the used switch and connect the wires to the terminals of the new bi-metal switch. Reattach the new switch to the detergent dispenser using the screws from the old switch. Replace the door panel and restore power to your dishwasher.

How to test a dishwasher timer with a multimeter:. Guide: How to check a timer. Steps: Use our step-by-step dishwasher repair guide to learn how to test your timer. Once you have diagnosed the problem we have theOEM replacement timerthat fits your appliance. The purpose of a dishwasher timer is to control the unit's cycles by regulating the length of time that power is directed to each component. It is not common for dishwasher timers to malfunction, and they are often misdiagnosed as having failed when they are actually fully operational. TIP:If you do have a timer motor that has failed, consider replacing just the motor itself and not the entire assembly. Timer motors can be considerably cheaper than the complete timer assembly. Before you can begin to test your dishwasher's timer motor, you must first locate the device. It is a part of the timer assembly. Timer assemblies are located either in the control panel at the top of the dishwasher door, or behind the lower kickplate at the bottom of the unit. To get to a timer located in the unit's control panel, first examine the outside of the appliance. Sometimes, depending on the model, you only have to remove a couple of screws in order to remove the outer control panel. In other cases, you will have to remove either the entire internal door panel, or the entire external door panel. In each case, the panel can be removed by removing anywhere from 6 - 10 screws. Be careful to not remove the screws at the very bottom of the door that are actually a part of the hinge assembly. Removing the hinge assembly screws will remove the entire door from the appliance, which is not at all necessary to test the unit's timer. With all of the screws removed, the door panel should be easy to lift off of the door assembly. If you have difficulty lifting the panel, look for other screws you may have missed. There may or may not be a smaller control panel cover. If you do discover one, it will be held in place with either a couple of screws or a couple of clips. With the dishwasher's control components fully exposed, you may discover that your model uses two timer motors. The second one will be a rapid advance motor. It is operational when the wash cycle is cancelled or reset. If you are unsure which timer is which, then test each of them. To get to a dishwasher timer located behind the lower kickplate at the bottom of the unit, simply remove the few screws holding the kickplate panel in place. With the panel removed, you will be able to identify and locate the timer and its motor. There will be two wires extending from the round motor housing. Follow the wires until you locate the connectors. Label the wires so that you will be able to reconnect them later in the right positions. Carefully remove the wires. Do not pull on the wire itself. Needle nose pliers may be needed to pull gently on the wire connector. Set your ohmmeter to the x 1000 setting. Take each probe and touch it to one wire. A normal reading for most dishwashers is in the 2000 to 3500 ohms range. Try to locate a schematic for your dishwasher. It should be in one of the service areas of your dishwasher or in the owner's manual. This schematic should indicate the proper resistance reading for your specific timer motor. If the reading you receive from testing your timer's motor differs greatly from the range presented here, then you should replace your timer motor, or the entire timer assembly.

Steps: Use our step-by-step dishwasher repair guide to learn how to test your heating element. Once you have diagnosed the problem we have theOEM replacement heating elementthat fits your appliance. Locate your dishwasher's heating element. Open the dishwasher door and look into the tub. It is the thin, circular tube at the base of your dishwasher. It may or may not be covered. If it is covered, remove the lower dishrack, and then remove the cover. Your heating element is going to have two metal terminals. One at each end. Each terminal reaches downwards, into the base of the dishwasher. Mentally mark the area where each terminal enters the base of the tub. Now you need to gain access to the heating element's wiring. You can do this by first removing the lower kickplate panel of the dishwasher. There will be at least two screws (but maybe four) holding the kickplate panel in place. They are located either on the top or the bottom of the panel. If the screws are located on the top, you may need to open the dishwasher door in order to gain access to them. Close the door to remove the panel, though. Now look into the lower access area that you have just uncovered. Pinpoint the area where the heating element terminals extend through the base of the dishwasher. They will each have a wire connected to it. Label each of the wires so that you will be able to properly reconnect them later. Now you can pull the wires off the terminals. Each wire is connected to a terminal using a slip-on connector. Grasp the connector and pull on it firmly.DO NOTpull on the wire itself. Pull only from the connector. You may decide you need to use a pair of needle nosed pliers to help you. Use your multitester (aka multimeter) to test the heating element for continuity. Set the device to the ohms setting x 1. Touch each meter probe to a terminal. You should receive a reading somewhere in between infinity and zero. Because of the variety of makes and models of dishwashers, it is quite difficult to say exactly what the reading should be for each and every possible model. However, if the test you conduct produces a reading of infinite resistance (meter's needle does not move), then that is indicative of a faulty heating element, and you should replace yours. Similarly, if the test you conduct produces a reading of zero resistance (meter's needle moves to the other extreme of the scale), then that is also indicative of a faulty heating element, and you should replace yours. You do not have to remove the heating element from the dishwasher in order to test it. Just make sure power is not getting to your dishwasher before you conduct the test.
